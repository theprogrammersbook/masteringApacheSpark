Furthermore, Sander loves sport. That is kick boxing, golfing, kite surfing and pool billard. Sabine is into gardening and art and travelling. Then we like the mountains and climbed some famous ones e.g. mount Kinabalu in Borneo but also did the Tour de Mont Blanc (the picture you see), tour de Vanoise. We love traveling.

I have my own private cosmetic clinic in south Amsterdam, next to the Hilton hotel. I am also an international trainer and key opinion leader for Allergan, the producer of Botox® and Juvéderm®.
I love to travel myself to all kinds of places, high - mid - low budget. 
I am a down to earth kind of guy, social and clean. Always looking for cute apartments to stay instead of inpersonal hotels. Staying at somebody's home usually gives a much more unique feeling during your holiday.

Lots of old characteristics are saved, but the house is comfortable in a 21th century way! There are two bedrooms, one with a double bed and one with a single bed (2 meters up). There is also room for an extra, comfortable bed on the floor. If needed I can arrange a cod. Please ask for it.  We have an open, fully equipped kitchen which looks into the living/dining room. The living room has lots of early 20",none,"Our neighborhood is very central, but also quiet. By foot you can walk to every major museum Amsterdam has to offer, all three museums guaranteed reachable within 5 minutes by foot! Within 1 square kilometer you will find everything you want: art, food, shopping.  ","Outside the city: If you take the train to Zandvoort you are at the beach in 30 minutes. Holland is not a very big country, so you can see other interesting cities very easy. For example the modern architecture of Rotterdam. This great city is only 80km away from Amsterdam.",Tram stop around the corner for tram 5 towards Central Station.  Bus stop from Schiphol Airport also around the corner. When you tell me your flight details I will e-mail you details about how to get to my place by public transport.

Thank you for visiting my listing. I love my home and am happy to welcome guests.

I am 48 years old and I live here with my partner Jan.  I  work in private health care, specialized with dementia. I started out as a home exchanger, so I know how great it feels to have a home away form home when you visit a big city. After a long day full of walking and sight seeing it is wonderful to get home and lay on a sofa or take a bath and get a fresh soda from your own fridge without a mini bar bill!

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me. If you like my house, please do not make a reservation request immediately, just send me a message. I never accept reservation requests without communicating with potential guests through email before. It is not a second home, but the house I live in. I do not rent it out to everybody. Thanks!

I will give you a virtual tour of the city and a great 3D map. Amsterdam is a city you can easily fall in love with, and I will make sure you'll fall in love with her as it happened for me.

I love this city and enjoy cruising around with my bike. I know every corner of it! I also love travelling and I always go to places where I know someone who can show me around and help me feel like a local, not just a tourist!
Many years ago I started to rent out my home to other travellers because I wanted to share my love and knowledge for Amsterdam and show what a great place it can be just with a bike and tips from a local. There is so much to see in Amsterdam. I believe you deserve to see what's really worth it and not just the touristic areas. I truly hope you can enjoy Amsterdam as much as I do.
I'll do my best to make you feel at home. How do I do it? First of all giving you a detailed map with loads of tips about restaurants, museums, coffee places where only locals go. Secondly providing you with tickets for anything you would like to see in advance, to avoid you waste of time. Transport cards, bikes, reservations for restaurants... Anything you might need!
I now manage other B&B's and self-catered apartments in the city. If this B&B is already booked I can always offer you some alternative. Friendly and professional: that's what best describes my work ethics. Looking forward to welcoming you here.

The first 10 years I spent in Amsterdam, I lived in many neighbourhoods. After having stayed in the Jordaan I knew that was the right place for me to call home. It has a lively village feel and the romantic and spacious canals create a feeling of freedom. Soon afterwards, now 13 years ago, I was lucky to find my home, the apartment that is available for you.

I like others to enjoy my lovely apartment when I am away. It is too pretty to sit empty and so well situated to experience Amsterdam. Right in the middle of all that Amsterdam has to offer!

I am from Amsterdam and work as an brand manager. I joined Airbnb in 2011 when I traveled a lot for work and enjoyed the idea that my space was being used by like-minded travelers. I know my city very well and usually prepare a personal list of favourites to advice my guests on where to go depending on their interests. My interests include interior design, cooking, Japanese ceramics, sports and music.

When traveling for leisure I enjoy going through Airbnb to find a local neighbourhood and enjoy the city as a local, I am a very respectful guest to your place and your neighbours.

I am Micha. I am running my place, B&B MNQUE with heart and soul. I really like to help my guests exploring the beautiful city Amsterdam, the place that I was born. I am running the B&B with a lot of passion and I really enjoy meeting new people from everywhere around the world.

Besides welcoming my wonderful guests, I also work as a communication/marketing specialist. That’s  one of my greatest passion. 

I have been lucky enough to take over this beautiful B&B that has existed for 9 years. I am extremely proud that the AirBnB community had rewarded this place with the Super host status.

I am 69 and do not work any more on a job, but I used to work as a public servant for the city. Living on a boat gives me a special feeling of freedom, space and view with my feet more or less in the water looking at the waterbirds and the boats passing by. I have a lovely dog, called Pommetje, a small labradoodle, born in Florida in 2009. In summer when the weather is fine I go boating through the canals which gives a different view of Amsterdam.

I am an American historian and journalist. I first visited Amsterdam when I was 16-years old, and from that moment I knew I wanted to live here. With its canals, bridges, and unique canal houses, I think it is one of the most beautiful cities in the world.
I just published a book 'Sex and Drugs before Rock 'n' Roll'. Youth Culture and Masculinity during Holland's Golden Age', and I work now as a journalist and write about art, history, nightlife, and sports for many tourist magazines about Amsterdam including Time Out Amsterdam, You in Amsterdam, and The Holland Times. I am always happy to advise guests at my place about the events going on in the city.

I will be happy to welcome you to my place and help you have a fantastic time in the city I call home.",N/A,N/A,67%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/1565512/profile_pic/1359666855/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/1565512/profile_pic/1359666855/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Jordaan,1,1,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews']",t,f,"Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands",Jordaan,Centrum-West,,Amsterdam,North Holland,1016,Amsterdam,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",NL,Netherlands,52.37094,4.87654,t,Apartment,Entire home/apt,3,1,1,1,Real Bed,"{TV,""Cable TV"",Internet,Wifi,Kitchen,""Buzzer/wireless intercom"",Heating,Dryer,""Smoke detector"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials}",,$165.00,$750.00,"$2,200.00",$200.00,$30.00,1,$0.00,5,14,5,5,14,14,5,14,5 months ago,t,0,0,18,160,2020-05-09,87,6,2012-02-10,2019-09-01,94,10,9,10,10,10,9,f,,"{Amsterdam,"" NL Zip Codes 2"","" Amsterdam"","" NL""}",f,f,moderate,f,f,1,1,0,0,0.87,,,

I live on the Amstel for 8 years. First we lived at a real boat, a sailing ship. We were in love of this place because of the oase of peace & nature in the middle of the city. But because of kids coming the ship became too small for 2 kids, so we started to realise an ark, this took about 1,5 year. On the 1st birthday of our daugther Luca this Ark was shipped to this place and still we are enjoying and we even love this place more and more.

Amsterdam is the city where I'am born and still living. The city is part of a large metropolitan area, stretching from Brussels to Amsterdam. My story is focussed on the specific characteristics of this area where I'm living, and of Tibet, the country I visited twice.

The Amsterdam area is geographically formed by a river delta in the Netherlands and Belgium, the confluence of the rivers Rhine, Meuse and Schelde. As the Rhine, streaming downwards from the mountains in Switzerland, contributes most of the water, the shorter term ""Rhine Delta"" is commonly used. 

In this ""Rhine Delta"" nowadays are living more than 20 million people below the mean sea level (roughly 0-6 meters).  Near to Amsterdam, other cities in this area are Brussels, Antwerp, Brugge, Gent, Vlissingen, Middelburg, Breda, Dordrecht, Rotterdam, 'Hertogenbosch, Delft, Gouda, The Hague, Leiden, Haarlem and Utrecht. Several of these cities are accessible from Amsterdam at a distance of up to 2 hours by TGV speed train. Life in this area is safeguarded predominantly by an ongoing 24/7 guarding of the dikes along the sea shores and the banks of the three rivers by the governmental water boards (in Dutch: ""waterschappen""). These boards are charged with managing water barriers, waterways, water levels, water quality and sewage treatment in their districts. `As regional water authorities they are among the oldest forms of local government, some of them having been founded in the 13th century in the coast regions of Belgium and the Netherlands. In times of crisis (breakthroughs of dikes or the threat thereof) they serve as Directors of the country, the Public Works Department. 

The Netherlands is a country where 60 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product is produced below sea level. Protecting the country from storms and floods isn’t treated here merely as a burden or a political football but as an economic and architectural challenge and opportunity. The dikes are our life saving borders between water and land.

Past generations have lost in the last 1.000 years some land to the rivers and the sea. In the same period the rivers and sea have delivered us also a lot of new land. This 24/7 struggle with the forces of water is a way of living between taking and giving land, between life and death. 

This historical attitude is the driving force, which has upgraded ""water management"" to a top academical specialty. One of the departments of the world known Technical University of Delft is its highly specialized Department of Water Management and Construction Works. Generations of scientists here are trained and have built up a large extent of knowledge in all kinds of water management and construction. 
Water management here depends on hard science and meticulous study. Other countries in the world use phrases like once-in-a-century storm. The Delft scientists, with a knowledge of water, tides and floods honed by painful experience, can calculate to the centimeter — and the Dutch government legislates accordingly — exactly how high or low to position hundreds of dikes along rivers and other waterways to anticipate storms they estimate will occur once every 25 years, or every 1,000 years, or every 10,000.

In the weapon of Zeeland, one of the coastal provinces, is written in Latin ""Luctor et Emergo"" what means ""I am struggling and will come back floating to the surface"".
Our countryname is simply 'the low lands at the sea': ""Nederland"", ""The Netherlands"", "" Pays-Bas"", ""هولندا"", ""Países Bajos"", ""荷兰"", ""països Baixos"", ""Niederlande"", ""Paesi Bassi"", ""Alankomaat"", ""Ολλανδία"", ""Nederländerna"", ""הולנד"", ""Belanda"", ""ｵﾗﾝﾀﾞ"", "" Holanda"", ""네덜란드"", ""Nīderlande"", ""Нидерланды"", ""Yr Iseldiroedd"", ""Hollanda""""Țările de Jos"" , ""Холандија"", ""Holandsko"", ""هلند"",""Nyderlandai"", ""Holland"", ""네덜란드"", ""Nizozemsko"".

It has been to the Netherlands, not surprisingly, that some American officials, planners, engineers, architects and others have been looking lately. New York is not Rotterdam (or Venice or New Orleans, for that matter); it’s not mostly below or barely above sea level. But it’s not adapted to what seems likely to be increasingly frequent extreme storm surges. And the question is how the Dutch engineers have more or less successfully held back the sea for centuries and thrived. For let us remember that as recently as 60 years ago (in geological eras ""a split second ago"") the North Sea disastrously flooded in 1953, devastating the southwest of this country and killing 1,835 people in a single night. In that same disastrous night in England, 307 people were killed in the counties of Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex. 28 were killed in West Flanders, Belgium. After that catastrophic combination of high tide and tempestuous winds, the Dutch engineers had to devise immediately an ingenious new network of dams, sluices and barriers called the ""Deltaworks"".

The ""Delta Works"" started in 1953 and were completed in 1998 (about 45 years later) upon completion of the last storm surge barrier ""Maeslantkering"", one giant movable sea gate guarding Europe's largest seaport and the nearly located city of Rotterdam. Only two river mouths of the existing shipping routes remained open. The first one of the rivers Rhine and Maes to the port of Rotterdam. And the second one of the river Schelde to the port of Antwerp, Europe's second largest seaport. The Maeslantkering is a new type of storm barrier with two moveable arms, as big and spectacular as ""a pair of Eiffel towers on their sides"", which can completely be pulled away or pushed forward. Opening or closing the arms of this barrier is a fully automated process. Before 1998, in an earlier stage, three other estuary mouths of the Oosterschelde, the Haringvliet and the Grevelingen were already blocked. This already had reduced the length of the dikes exposed to the sea by approximately 400 miles (640 km). 

The history of trying to hold back the sea for centuries is nowadays changing, as the Dutch engineers in the end realize they are facing a losing battle. In 2013 the most recent policy is: ""letting the water in"", The evidence is leading them to undertake what may seem, at first blush, a counterintuitive approach, a kind of about-face. The engineers are starting to let the water in. This new strategy has one slogan ""Room for the River"". They are contriving to live with nature, rather than fight what will inevitably be, - they have come to realize in the end - a losing battle. Sea barriers sufficed half a century ago; but they’re disruptive to the ecology and are built only so high, while the waters keep rising. Instead of ""flood control"" the new policy is ""controlled flooding"".

The centerpiece of the new Dutch water management now is an € 2,3 billion program of the Government. It consists of nearly 40 interconnected infrastructure projects to mitigate climate change along the waterways and rivers. Dikes are being lowered, spillways created. As a consequence of these decisions you can imagine there were many legal battles, public protests, people being uprooted, lands repurposed. But the benefits are clear and widely shared. Hard decisions need to be made to cope with rising waters and severe weather. The new calculations are expected to be completed in 2015. For the three rivers an upgrade is in operations, which is expected to be finished in 2017.

Two journeys gave me in the last ten years a clear new insight, an award.

In the years 2006 and 2008 I was traveling twice to Tibet.
Tibet is a beautiful country where 15 million people (50% original Tibetans and 50% Chinese) are living. The whole area is in sqkm's roughly as big as Europe where a total of 500 million inhabitants have their existence. 

In the first journey (in 2006) I travelled up to a mean height of 3.500 meters above the mean sea level. In the second one (in 2008) I climbed up to 6.000 meters on the mount Kailash. The Tibetan name for the mountain is ""precious jewel of snow"".Tibetan Buddhists see the mountain as the navel of the universe. This mountain lies near the source of some of the longest rivers in Asia: the Indus River, the Brahmaputra River, and the Ganges River. Tibet has therefore been called the ""Water Tower"" of Asia. And China is therefore investing heavily in water projects in Tibet.

The higher I climbed above the sea level all the more my body was in need of oxygen. For my survival I moved slowly, breathed very regularly, drank gallons of water and slept down in the most peaceful and coldest nights ever. Though especially prepared for this experiences, I was overwhelmed by them. Up there on ""the roof of the world"" I had some moments of full insight into the existential differences between Tibet and the Netherlands, the differences of life on 6.000 m above the mean sea level, or 6 m below it.

These journeys were an impressive award.",N/A,N/A,N/A,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2063612/profile_pic/1336396510/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2063612/profile_pic/1336396510/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Grachtengordel,1,1,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'jumio']",t,t,"Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands",Grachtengordel,Centrum-Oost,,Amsterdam,North Holland,1017 VW,Amsterdam,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",NL,Netherlands,52.363,4.89917,t,Apartment,Entire home/apt,4,2,2,3,Real Bed,"{TV,""Cable TV"",Internet,Wifi,""Wheelchair accessible"",Kitchen,Gym,Heating,Washer,Dryer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",""First aid kit"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo,Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49"",""translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50""}",,$299.00,,"$5,999.00",$350.00,,1,$0.00,180,365,180,180,365,365,180,365,8 months ago,t,23,53,83,358,2020-05-09,78,0,2012-05-22,2015-07-16,98,9,10,10,10,10,9,f,,"{Amsterdam,"" NL""}",f,f,strict_14_with_grace_period,t,t,1,1,0,0,0.8,,,

I am a 33-years old woman, living with my 4-years old daughter, in one of  the most epic town of the world: Amsterdam.
Ten years ago i came here to study medicine. Currently I am specializing to be a general practitioner (housedocter, huisarts).
I love travelling around the world and meeting new people. But also reading books, visiting musea and going to the cinema. We have this beautiful cinema art house dating from 1900, and I go there every week..
Other things I can't live without is good food, good friends and family ;-)

Airbnb has been an truly wonderfull experience to me so far. I had so many great guests, and everytime it is a big succes!. It's fun to meet people this way. I use Airbnb myself, and it has been an adventure everytime. To me, it seems like the perfect way to get out of town and get the true spirit of a local in Berlin, London or where so ever. 
I have a real ""open house""; a lot of friends are part of the furniture. I'm used to being hospitable. I like to help other people having a nice holiday, hoping that we will have too whenever we use someone else 's home!

The last few years we spend most of our spare time -besides running of course- renovating our house in the center of Amsterdam. We renewed the foundation, restored the souterrain, made an apartment and a small studio and made our own space as comfortable as can be.

I came to his city in 1982 and probably will never leave anymore. I love my city, my house, my family, my friends and many other things. Really Amsterdam, ‘ the biggest village on earth’, offers so many beautiful things. We love to bike down town for coffee, shopping at the organic Noord Market or the so called Nine Streets, strolling in the Vondelpark, going to Paradiso or theatre with our daughters.  Many times we feel like tourists in our own town! 
I was educated as teacher French and Dutch but switched to the fashion industry as there was not enough work in teaching at that time. As a fashion agent I sell woman clothes to shops. As my business becomes more difficult the last year I decided to start b&b, and I love it. 
I also love to go hiking in the Alps or reading my books in our beach hut  at half an hour from where we live. 
I love going to cinema especially documentaries and art house films, and: yoga, meeting family and friends.

If you stay with us, there is a big chance that you meet my partner Karel as well. His work is project manager for art in public space. He is even a more enthousiatic mountaineer as I am: he also loves to climb the rocks as well. And when I am reading my book he is a probably out for sailing on the sea in his Laser. 
 
My two daughters can give you the best advices where to spend your money with shopping. They are working hard at school and dreaming and saving money for their round-the-world-trip within a few years.

Our two cats like sleeping very much.

In 2013 we bought the boat "" The Calidris"". The main reason to live on a boat was to stay in the city, but still had enough space and above all, freedom. It feels like a little community in this street, because the boat people hang out together, help eachother and know eachother well.

We are very happy to live in such a special place in Amsterdam, enough space, nice views, but still connected to the city! We like cooking together, traveling with our 3 boys, designing our home, making boat trips. 

In 2014 we started our B&B. Where you sleep now, it used to be the captain's cabin. We immediately removed the stairs, so we do not miss the space at all. It as always a dream for me to run a little boutique hotel. Nowadays we don't run a hotel, but a pittoresque B&B, which we really enjoy. It is fun to meet people all over the world who mostly have a great time at our boat. When you would like to see how houseboat-people live just knock on the door and we will show you around!

My name is Carli! I am from Scotland but have been living in Amsterdam for 6 years. I love to travel, half of my family are from Malta so I have lived and worked there for a while before I went travelling around Europe. It was in those travels that I discovered Amsterdam and fell in love with this city. I just knew I had to live here.

My two other passions in life are good food/cooking and hiking in some of Hollands beautiful parks, forests and beaches.

This means you have access to all sorts of leisure, from sports in Westerpark, to bars, restaurants, coffee bars, coffeeshops, cinema (At The Movies located on Haarlemerstraat is the oldest cinema of the Netherlands), while Central Station is just 10 minutes by bike, bus or tram. In case you want to do groceries, search 'Albert Heijn' or 'Dirk van der Broek' in your maps app. Both take 5 minutes by bike or 10 minutes walking.

It will lead to immediate eviction from the apartment. Furthermore, any (financial) damages for breaking the house rules will be forwarded to the person who booked the property. City officials sometimes come by the apartment in person to ask questions. In case this happens during your stay, do NOT open the door or talk to them. Contact me immediately by phone and do not provide them with any information under any circumstance. Don't answer the door to any strangers or talk to anyone about the rental agreement. The fine for receiving a complaint from neighbours is €6000. It doesn't matter whether there is anything to complain about. When neighbours complain and the city confirms there are tourists in the apartment, I will receive a €6000 fine. Therefore it is not allowed to talk to anyone about the rental agreement.

The architect of this house is Piet Kramer.",We are flexible to arrange the check in with you. However we always like to welcome you in person and help you with tips or other useful information.

It is close to numerous attractions. It is walking distance to the lovely Vondelpark (an ideal summer hangout spot), Museumplein (museum district with the famous Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh museum and Stedelijk Museum) and PC Hooftstraat (luxury shopping street). Also the Olympic stadium and Zuidas business district are around the corner.  The streets around the apartment offer everything you need: a lot of nice cafes and restaurants, a bookshop, bike rental, supermarket, pharmacy and Saturday market. With public transportation it is only 10 minutes to the city center/canal area (Leidseplein, 9 straatjes, Spui etc.).",,"Getting Around There are multiple bus and tram stops within walking distance of the apartment. Busses/trams leave every 5 minutes.  From the airport, the apartment can be easily reached by public transportation within 20 mins with a bus stop just around the corner (bus #197). Also the train station 'station Amsterdam zuid' is very close by. From the Railway Station 'Amsterdam Central Station' it is best to take tram #16 (towards 'VU Medisch Centrum') that leaves in front of the central station, and get out at the stop 'Valeriuspleín'. The tram ride will take about 20 minutes. From there it is just a 3 minute walk to my apartment.  A really useful app for getting public transportation information in the Netherlands is 9292ov. It's free and available in English, and you simply enter your departure location and destination and it gives you all available routes and times.","Guest Access You will have access to everything described above, including fresh towels and bed linen but also complete kitchen equipment (including stored foods, as long as you replace it :)).","Interaction with Guests A nice booklet will be available for you in which I listed my favorite places in the neighborhood and Amsterdam in general.

After university I moved to Amsterdam and enjoy it so much I stayed there. Most of my 22 years here I lived in the area I bought this apartment in called 'The Baarsjes' which is a type of fish.

My main job here is in IT and besides that music is a major part of my life; studied classical music (theory) and am a trained classical singer (baritone). I also play the piano and clarinet. 

I speak Dutch, English, German and some French. It's hard for me to speak to you in Italian or Spanish but beware, I do understand most of what you are saying ;-)

About six years ago, when a neighbor came by with a pack f puppies, I immediately yelled that I AM NOT A DOG PERSON. A few days later I bought the dog and every day I am amazed how wonderful it is to share your life with a dog.

When I travel myself I prefer to stay somewhere where I can cook my own food, not because of a strict diet, but I enjoy shopping for food at local markets plus it's a relaxing activity for me. As for destinations, I tend to stay within Europe so I can take my dog with me. Since I have a dog I walk a lot and I love to take long hikes in thinly populated areas and camping in the wild.

Well I am George, I am originally from Brazil but I live in Amsterdam, this gr8 city, for  many years! 
What you get: a nice and clean private  room. The bath room is right in front of your room and the comfortable kitchen is just beside it. There's a nice balcony where you can sit to enjoy the sunshine, smoke a joint, if you like it :). You have a lot of comfort and privacy. 
More about me: I am very relax guy, I like smoke weed sometimes, partying :) ... but I have a health life style too, sporting and eating healthy.
Like to give you info and tips about places to go, if you need it, and I like you to feel at your home and I am sure you will ;)
I am just starting here and so this is my first text. On the future I hope I can do it better. You are from heart welcome to stay in my place.
Oh! The coffee, tea in the kitchen is free. You may buy your own groceries and cook your own breakfast any time you want. No restrictions about the time to go in and out of the house. You get your own keys to the apartment. If you like stay awake all night in in the room or make food in the middle of the night, you may!!! It doesn't bother me! 
Looking forward to welcome you in Amsterdam. Have a nice trip! :)

Cheers, 
George

From Kinkerstraat you can take tram 17 to the Dam square, (main square of Amsterdam) Westermarkt (Anne Frank House) and Central Station within 7-15 mins. Also you can take tram 7 and be in 4 minutes in the night most lively area of Amsterdam (Leidseplein) and all A'dam south and East.","You will have access to the living room to chill in the couch or watch your series on Netflix, just so you feel like home.

For the eternally inquisitive, many will try to second-guess what de Pijp stands for but the truth is, no one really knows. Perhaps it owes its name to the long narrow streets that resemble pipes or to the infamous gas company, the ‘Pipe’, which used to supply energy to the area. Whoever or whatever is responsible for the name should be proud of the association. Formerly a working class quarter built to ease the overpopulated Jordaan in the 19 th century and to house labourers, de Pijp as we Amsterdammers know it today is without doubt a melting pot of cultures and nationalities. Thanks to previous settlers such as Heijermans, De Haan, Bordewijk, Mondriaan and scores of students in search of a cheap room to rent, de Pijp continues to breathe life as the lively bohemian district known as the Quartier Latin (Latin Quarter).

Occupying an area bordered by the stately Vondelpark and the Singelgracht canal, Oud-West and neighbouring De Baarsjes are the result of rapid urban expansion in the last quarter of the 19th century. Prior to that, the semi-circular Singelgracht had demarcated Amsterdam’s outer limits, and earlier still, the Overtoom – nowadays a busy arterial road running parallel to the Vondelpark, and the best place in town for furniture shopping – was a footpath connecting Amsterdam with the town of Sloten. As such, it was part of the route that had brought thousands of European pilgrims to Amsterdam following the 1345 ‘Miracle of Amsterdam’, providing the city with its very first tourists.

“Please be a traveler, not a tourist. Try new things, meet new people and look beyond what’s right in front of you. Those are the keys to understanding this amazing world we live in.”

Travelling has always been big part of my life. I love to discover new place, meet new people and learn new cultures. 
Next to travelling I also have a passion for sports, photography, creative dressing up, and everything related to spirituality and self development.

While travelling I like to share my home with other travellers and I do my best to make sure they have the best experience possible.

Ik heb sinds kort mijn eigen huisje op een van de leukste plekjes van Amsterdam en dit wil ik jullie natuurlijk niet onthouden :)

Amsterdam, daar moet je zijn geweest! De leukste winkels, rondwandelingen, de lekkerste restaurantjes, de mooiste hofjes, de geschiedenis van de stad, de monumenten, musea in de buurt, uitgaansgelegenheden... noem maar op.

Ik zal proberen jouw verblijf zo aangenaam mogelijk te maken, onder andere door je te voorzien van alle toeristische info die je nodig hebt. Daarnaast ben ik of een contactpersoon altijd in de buurt, dus mocht er iets zijn kan je mij meteen bellen.

Ik ben zelf zeer reislustig, heb alle continenten zo'n beetje wel gezien, maar nog lang niet klaar natuurlijk. 
In m'n vrije tijd vind ik het heerlijk om te koken, eten en dingen te ondernemen met vrienden. 

Tot snel in Amsterdam!

ENGLISH

Hi, my name is Claire and welcome on my profile! I have recently moved in to a beautiful apartment in Amsterdam and I would like to share this with you all :)

Amsterdam is a beautiful city to discover! This is the town where you can marvel in beautiful picturesque little streets, where you can photograph old buildings, where you find original shops, where you can have a drink with the locals or go out to the best restaurants in the city. What Amsterdam has to offer? The nicest shops, walking tours, restaurants, the most beautiful alms-houses, history of the neighborhood, monuments, museums and many other entertainment areas. And this all within 10 minutes of the apartment!

I'll try to make your stay as pleasant as possible by giving you all the touristic information you need. Also, me or one of my friend will be in the neighbourhood, so if there's anything you need don't hesitate to call.

I like to travel a lot. I've seen all the continents but off course I'm far from being finished! Furthermore, I love to cook and eat (which my kitchen might show...) and hanging out with friends.

See you soon in Amsterdam!",N/A,N/A,75%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/c8be66aa-cc22-4b30-86f7-108bd7fd2378.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/c8be66aa-cc22-4b30-86f7-108bd7fd2378.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Oud-West,1,1,"['phone', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'offline_government_id', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual']",t,f,"Amsterdam, Noord-Holland, Netherlands",Oud-West,De Baarsjes - Oud-West,,Amsterdam,Noord-Holland,1056,Amsterdam,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",NL,Netherlands,52.3706,4.86394,t,Apartment,Entire home/apt,2,1,1,1,Real Bed,"{TV,""Cable TV"",Internet,Wifi,Kitchen,""Paid parking off premises"",Heating,""Family/kid friendly"",Washer,Dryer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",""First aid kit"",""Safety card"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo,Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50"",""Hot water"",""Bed linens"",""Extra pillows and blankets"",""Luggage dropoff allowed"",""Host greets you""}",,$116.00,,,$250.00,$40.00,1,$0.00,2,112,2,2,112,112,2,112,2 months ago,t,0,0,0,0,2020-05-08,32,5,2016-05-29,2020-01-19,94,10,10,10,10,10,9,f,,"{Amsterdam,"" NL Zip Codes 2"","" Amsterdam"","" NL""}",f,f,strict_14_with_grace_period,f,f,1,1,0,0,0.67,,

I'm Jacqueline, 35, live and work in Amsterdam as a nurse. 
Love to travel, see and explore another world, cultures and habits. 
I try to make a long trip every year, or at least a few short trips. The most memorable trip was the one to Cameroon. But i am also a huge fan of Asia. Next on the list is South America.
Next to traveling i like to cook, wander around, take photo's, catching a good film, host or attend dinnerparty's. 

What i love about airbnb is the experience of seeing and feeling the city/village as a local. Therefore i'd like to give fellowtravelers something back. 
Because my travels are often for a longer period of time and therefore i am not allways at home to welcome guests personally (unfortunately), i asked 'the friendly host' to take over when i am away. I have good experiences with them and i trust them to make the stay just as personal as i would do so myself.
