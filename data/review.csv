2818,1191,2009-03-30,10952,Lam,Daniel is really cool. The place was nice and clean. Very quiet neighborhood. He had maps and a lonely planet guide book in the room for you to use. I didnt have any trouble finding the place from Central Station. I would defintely come back! Thanks!
2818,1771,2009-04-24,12798,Alice,"Daniel is the most amazing host! His place is extremely clean, and he provides everything you could possibly want (comfy bed, guidebooks & maps, mini-fridge, towels, even toiletries). He is extremely friendly and helpful, and will go out of his way to help you if needed, or just let you come and go as you please. Highly recommended!"
2818,1989,2009-05-03,11869,Natalja,"We had such a great time in Amsterdam. Daniel is an excellent host! Very friendly and everytime helpful. The room was cozy, comfortable, and VERY clean. Maps, towels, mini-fridge, coffee (very tasty) and tea supplies were provided. Bathroom with all the bathroom requires. Good location - next to the tram stop and it took just around 10-15 minutes to get to the city center.
Totally recommendable! "
2818,2797,2009-05-18,14064,Enrique,Very professional operation. Room is very clean and comfortable. Location is close to tram or bus which take you to most of attractions. A great and helpful host who want to ensure you enjoy your stay.  
2818,3151,2009-05-25,17977,Sherwin,Daniel is highly recommended.  He provided all necessities (and actually went way beyond what's expected of a great host). His place is very clean.  It is also convenient to buses and trams which will take you around the city in minutes.  You will truly feel like a local here.
2818,4748,2009-06-29,20192,Jie,"Daniel was a great host! He made everything so easy for us! The room was super clean and well equipped, the beds were very comfortable! Daniel also gave us good advices,  tips and tools (maps, compass, umbrella..) for getting around the city. The place is located in the quiet neighbourhood so we are away from all the noises, but it is also very close to all the public transportations so getting into the city is fairly easy and fast. I highly recommend Daniele's place!

2818,5202,2009-07-07,23055,Vanessa,"Daniele is an amazing host! He provided everything that was needed to make our stay comfortable and easy! The rooms were clean and cozy; and he took the time to show us how to get around Amsterdam via public transportation or riding around on bicycles. You truly do feel like a local when staying with Daniele!!
"
2818,9131,2009-09-06,26343,Katja,"You can´t have a nicer start in Amsterdam. Daniel is such a great and welcoming host. The room was really light and charming, so well decorated. Daniel has a great sense of hospitality, he even helped with our luggage and gave us maps and a travelguide. He´s very open minded and helpful. We had a great time, we would stay with him again anytime we´re back in Amsterdam. Daniel made sure we had everything for a great trip, thanks again for the bikes! Hope to see you soon, Daniel!"
2818,12103,2009-10-01,40999,Marie-Eve,"Daniel was a fantastic host. His place is calm and clean, and he provided so much information on how to enjoy the amazing city of Amsterdam. Should I return to the city, his place will be my first choice! "
2818,16196,2009-11-04,38623,Graham,"Daniel was great. He couldn.t do enough for us. He has gone to a lot of trouble and added every little touch to his apartment. He can speak 5 languages so that should not be a problem for anyone.
The accomation had everything we needed and was very convienient to the bus and tram."
2818,18095,2009-11-23,48138,Klaus,"Daniel has been more then a great host: it was like having an home in Amsterdam!
If friendliness and kindness were not enough, the house was super clean and he provided all the things needed for our staying: maps, timetables, suggestions and tips, even bicycles! The location is easy to get to and from the station and the city center, 24h/24h connection, with a relaxing and serviced neighborhood. And don't worry, he speaks 5 languages if you mind having communication problems. Hope to find other guest like him in the future!"
2818,18286,2009-11-25,55661,Michael,"Daniel's apartment and room was spotless. Daniel was very friendly throughout our correspondence and was even waiting for me outside his place when I arrived (late). The apartment is very convenient to the center of the city, and an easy walk to the transportation stops. Daniel is well prepared for any guest, providing me with maps and bus schedules. I would not hesitate to stay here again. Daniel is wonderful host."
2818,24925,2010-01-27,33284,Araz,"Daniel was an exeptional host!! We only had a short stay in Amsterdam but Daniel was extremely helpful as he had all the local transport timetables mapped out and ready for us to use. His place was very clean and comfortable. Daniel was incredibly accommodating on our last day in Amsterdam. Our flight wasn't till the evening and he was kind enough to let us leave our luggage for the day and return to pick them up before our flight. TOTALLY, TOTALLY, TOTALLY recommend Daniel's place next time you visit Amsterdam."
2818,31154,2010-03-24,82918,Natalie,"No amount of praise for Daniel would be corny or excessive.  His place was comfortable and wonderful, and he is an incredibly friendly and accommodating host.  I felt cleaner, safer, and happier than at any hotel.  A friend and I stayed here, and we loved having the twin beds in the same room.  The shower was luxurious and clean, and Daniel provided us with maps, restaurant recommendations, bikes, and tea service!  I just asked my travel companion ""What else can I say about Daniel's place?"" and he was like, ""OH MAN!  It's one thing to expect breakfast from a B&B, and it's quite another to be chez Daniel.  His command of the nuances of hosting are unmatched."""
2818,35916,2010-04-16,97200,Ludovic,"It's the perfect place: clean, safe, noiseless, with a perfect owner.  Moreover with the hash from Island, we were stucked in amstedam and daniel help us a lot. So thanks you Daniel. If you have to come to Amsterdam, choose the Daniel's place and you will enjoy your holidays."
2818,36774,2010-04-19,103149,Faisal,"When you reach at Dainel place, be sure that all things are ready to greet you. May it be meticulously made room or spick & span bathroom or well-thought-of information on ""Things To Do"" along with relevant maps & transportation schedule to explore the city to the fullest. Nothing misses out from Daniel's radar.
His pleasing personality with great asthetic sense is just an icing on the cake.We would definately stay with him again.Thanks again for making us feel at home."
2818,39856,2010-05-03,112391,Rickey,"Daniel is a terrific host, like one of the other people stated Danile provided me with great maps and recommendations. I would stay with Daniel again anytime. "
2818,45708,2010-05-24,79479,David,Daniel was a fantastic host and we would absolutely stay again with him. Everything was as advertised and you can easily get anywhere from his apartment. 
2818,48766,2010-06-01,99878,Josh,"Our stay with Daniel was truly one of the highlights of mine and my partner's whirlwind European tour. Not only was the room smashingly decorated (a great example of modern Dutch living), spotlessly clean and serenely comfortable {think Zen), but having Daniel as a point of reference was our key to discovering the city. From the get-go he freely offered advice whenever we had questions about where to go or what to do in Amsterdam. 

The room is located at quite a distance from the heart of the city, but we didn't find this hindering. We were able to get to the center in a snap with the two bikes Daniel has available for a minimal charge or via any of the train or bus stops located within a stones throw of his front door. There are plenty of restaurants, cafes and groceries in the area. And staying here is also a great way to see how the locals are living.

I would recommend Daniel's residence to anyone looking for a smart, affordable alternative to hotels or hostels. As a gay couple especially we found him extremely welcoming. 

P.S. You can check my YouTube page for videos of our stay in Amsterdam, which includes a peek into the room: (Website hidden by Airbnb)"
2818,54108,2010-06-17,131821,Amelia,"Daniel was very accomodating and friendly. It was a little pricey for what it was. The bed was smaller than a dormitory bed, and as a college student, I would know. The neighborhood seemed relatively safe but I did get hassled a few times outside of the apartment. Overall, I was impressed but I probably would stay closer to the city center in the future."
2818,54654,2010-06-19,97097,Jenn,Daniel's place was great! We got so much relaxing in. We loved staying there are really appreciated his great hospitality! He gave us great tips on getting around etc. I would recommend his place to anyone traveling to Amsterdam.
2818,58048,2010-06-27,147769,Andrew,"Just a short note - my first experience with AirBnB was with Daniel and it was stellar.  Exactly as indicated and advertised, the service was exemplary.  As a person who does a lot of business travelling, I found Daniel to be an informed and professional host.  Much better service than harried business travellers normally recieve.  For example he answered many questions about the local transportation, the scene, and the best way to spend our time.  He also arranged for bikes which is undoubtedly the best way to see the city.  I highly recommend Daniel to anyone considering a trip to Amsterdam, the experience was completely positive."
2818,62552,2010-07-08,15745,David,"Daniel was an exceptional host!  I was primarily happy because of the following 3 characteristics:

1) Friendliness and knowledgeability of the host -- Along with my reservation I received very carefully laid out instructions to arrive at Daniel's doorstep and he was right there waiting for me when and where he said he would be.  One evening Daniel invited me to drink a beer with him and he shared his personal story about arriving in Amsterdam years ago and what attracted him to the city.  We also spent time talking about the culture of Holland and how its position as a trading port influenced the ideals of the city.  Daniel had good recommendations for how and when to see various tourist spots and had some alternative recommendations (local pools, bibliotech (library), etc...).

2) Cleanliness of the place -- Daniel's apartment is spotless.  The particular room was very well cared-for and had all of the accessories needed.

3) All the ""little extras"" -- Daniel opened a fresh pair of slippers for me upon arrival.  He also had a nicely laid out tea/coffee set in the room, 3 different tour books about Amsterdam which helped me plan my days, a plastic map which I could carry throughout the adventures, a bicycle available to rent, matching set of shampoo/conditioner/lotion in the bathroom, etc...  an adapter for my US plugs.  Everything was well thought-out and Daniel gave a lot of attention to make sure that the visit was superb."
2818,73222,2010-08-03,164729,Michel,"Daniel is a great host. He is a very sweet and courteous person and he seems to truly enjoy hosting guests. His apartment is very tidy and clean and it's not often that you come across such a clean and well organized place (you would have to go 4 stars or higher!). He provides everything the guests could think of (or at least that I can think of): bikes, towels, shampoo, conditioner, shower cap, different maps, guides etc. and he will always be of service when information or recommendations are needed. Daniel is very easy to deal with and it was a pleasure to stay with him.
Thank you Daniel."
2818,74084,2010-08-05,171625,Lezle,"We spent two nights at Daniel's and very much enjoyed it. Early on, he e-mailed very explicit directions on how to reach his home and upon reaching there, he had maps and travel guides handy and was available to answer any questions. The room was quiet, comfortable, and meticulous. His place is a bit out of the central area of Amsterdam, but is easily accessible by tram. It was also nice to be away from the crowds and in a local neighborhood. We would thoroughly recommend his place and would stay again when in the area!"
2818,87063,2010-08-30,175043,Andrew,"Daniel was an excellent host, and I whole heartedly recommend his accomodations. He is pleasant, the place was very clean, and the location was perfect - a 10-15 minute bus or metro ride to downtown and quiet in the evening. On my next visit to Amsterdam, I would absolutely stay with Daniel again. "
2818,91025,2010-09-06,105289,Nadia,Daniel is a fantastic host who cares about the details of his guest's stay in Amsterdam. He was a blessing when it came to getting directions of where we needed to go. He definitely comes excellently-recommended!
2818,94243,2010-09-10,202035,Agam,"Daniel's setup was very good.  Like other reviewers have said before, he has a lot of nice little touches and everything is extremely well thought out in providing a seamless experience for his guests.  

Daniel himself was really nice and accommodating.  He helped me figure out all my public transportation needs, weather predictions and requests.

His place is clean and near lots of different tram lines, so you can get pretty much anywhere.  Also he seems to work around your schedule in terms of cleaning the room and letting you use the shower, etc.  So it's just really comfortable in that regard where you don't feel like you are imposing too much.

There are also some food options around his apartment to grab some food late at night which is always handy.  Would definitely stay there agin."
2818,97728,2010-09-15,211004,Alexandra,"Our stay at Daniel was awesome. He has a beautiful flat which is very tidy and neat. The room to rent is also very nice. It has two comfy beds and a wardrobe. Daniel also provides a private kettel, a range of tea and coffee. There are also towels for which Daniel provides a special space in the bathroom. 
What was outstanding, was that Daniel also lent us two of his bikes. This was most helpful as we hadn't to figure out the public transport and were free to discover Amsterdam by bike. Even if you would have to take the bus or tram the appartment is located idealy to various stops. "
2818,105516,2010-09-26,217961,Sam,"my stay with Daniel was truly one of the highlights of of my visit to amsterdam.

"
2818,112271,2010-10-05,227259,Diana,"Daniel makes his guests feel completely welcome,  he checks in to make sure you are having a great time and if you need anything further. He is always available by phone. The room is well appointed with maps and information to get you around the Amsterdam seamlessly.  The room is nicely decorated and very clean with a armoire for your clothes so you don't need to live out of your suitcase. I would definitely stay at Daniel's again.  I had a great time."
2818,114145,2010-10-08,224147,Sylvia,"Daniel's place was without a doubt the most rewarding of our trip to Europe. His attention to details and kindness make his place an excellent alternative for those considering a bed and breakfast in Amsterdam
I strongly advise to consider his place: Great location, an affordable price, a clean and organized room and a great host. What else can you ask for?
Thanks Daniel
Hope to see u soon!"
2818,117153,2010-10-12,216750,Darlo,"My sister and I had a awesome experience in Amsterdam and it all started with Daniel, his graciousness as a host - helping us find his quiet apartment, his tea and conversations, maps, comfortable room and accommadations. We would definately stay at Daniel's the next time we visit Amsterdam. "
2818,126525,2010-10-25,241053,Roberto,"Staying st Daniel's was flawless, everything was perfect. Daniel has everything well organized and well planned for the guests. He provides maps and books of Amsterdam, and he is always available for any help you might need.

The room is very quiet, and well decorated, very clean.
He provides the room with towels, tea, coffee and a wardrobe.

I felt very comfortable, I would stay again. "
2818,140762,2010-11-17,268213,Rahul,"Daniel's place was very nice and the neighbourhood was good as well. Everything very close and reachable. If you are travelling outside amsterdam for business the station and public transport is very convinient.

Daniel is a great host. Always recomendable.

Regards
Rahul"
2818,143537,2010-11-23,54482,Marta,"Me and my boyfriend have spent three nights at Daniel´s place, and we are very pleased with the choice. Daniel is charming, always aware that everything was fine. His house is very nice, very clean and beautiful. The room is very nice and the beds are very comfortable. We had at our disposal free bikes, coffee ant tea, guides, towels, hair dryer...
The only downside is that we couldn´t be much with Daniel, who was a lovely person!
If we go back to Amsterdam we would repeat for sure!
Thank you Daniel!"
2818,161816,2011-01-01,329040,Leigh And Stefanie,Daniel provides 5 star service. He is a super nice guy and he is super friendly and well organized. I was traveling with a buddy and everything worked out great. My stay was over a year ago and I only just figured out how to write a review. Happy travels everyone !
2818,194298,2011-03-07,374779,Drew,"Daniel's place is a fantastic place to stay in Amsterdam if you expect to be spending (as you should) most or all of your time out and about in the city. It's particularly well-suited to the solo traveller and Daniel is a fantastic host. 

Slightly outside the 'core' of Amsterdam, but transport is extremely convenient and Daniel is hugely accommodating with late-night schedules. 

Only thing I'd say is that it is best if you have experienced what European apartments are actually like. Daniel's is really, really nice - but it IS European. If you're fresh off the plane from North America and have never been to Europe before I'd suggest you get a hotel for a few days first. But I'd say that about any European apartment. 

Hugely enjoyed my time. Highly recommend.  "
2818,196836,2011-03-11,422476,Colin,"Staying at Daniel's apartment was great! My boyfriend and I stayed here two nights and were very happy to do so. Daniel was a terrific host who made us feel at home. The room we stayed in was lovely and comfortable, and he provided us with a hair dryer, towels, tea and coffee, maps and guide books. He was a wealth of information in terms of when to go to certain museums, what was and wasn't worthwhile, and the best ways to get around using public transportation. He even allowed us to use his bikes free of charge! He was very accommodating and accepted our booking very last minute, and didn't mind that we were arriving late in the evening on a weeknight. The location of his apartment is also great--near both train and bus stops, in a nice, quiet neighborhood. I would absolutely recommend staying here! "
2818,214718,2011-04-01,442422,Angela,"Daniel's apartment was perfect for my 5 days in Amsterdam (march 2011) and was a great value. It is only 5 minutes away from the bus and is in a safe residential area. The area has public transports, restaurants, laundry, supermarket. The apartment was also very comfortable and very well-equipped. The kitchen, work desk, shower and bathroom were all very nice. It is well maintained, very clean, nicely decorated. The bed is really comfortable, the sheets are soft and fragrant. There were beautiful flowers, tea and hot water inside my room. He has an eye for everything, is friendly and very professional. Daniel arranged everything and advised me before the trip. His manager went well beyond to answer my daily questions, taught me how travel around the city, and was nearby most times or quickly responded to my messages.  In short: go to Amsterdam, rent Daniel's appartment and be happy. Thanks again, Daniel for a great stay! Angela (Brazil)."
2818,232163,2011-04-19,485490,Aisling,"Great Trip, accomodation was very clean and Daniel was very welcoming and professional. He provides hotel-like accomodation with a real feeling of Amsterdam. Would highly recommend a stay at Daniel's. "
2818,260298,2011-05-12,229991,Marsha,"Daniel is an amazing host!  The room is exceptionally comfortable, very good mattresses, very pretty, light and airy.  There is a tea service area with a small fridge that was very convenient.  The environment was exceptionally clean, organized and Daniel has maps and a wealth of information available for tourists.  He was great at helping us to make arrangements for tourist tickets online.  The most wonderful thing about his location is the neighborhood, especially if you are looking for a local experience.  It was very easy to use the public transit system from his location.  Everything is close.  Daniel offered bikes to use and that was fabulous.  Daniel did everything possible to provide a pleasant experience and we had an amazing time.  I highly recommend Daniel's place.  "
2818,314616,2011-06-14,636413,Sabine,We spent  a few day by Daniel. We have a very good accomotion. Daniel is very kind and busy man for his guest. We will come back to Amsterdam and defently go to Daniel. 
2818,330647,2011-06-23,668411,Marcia,"Daniel is a welcoming and accommodating host who is interesting to talk with. The room is attractive and very comfortable. The location is not far by public transport from anything that you might want to do in Amsterdam. Don't hesitate to ask Daniel questions about things to do, how to get there, and especially places to eat. His recommendations are excellent!

We loved our stay in Amsterdam and would gladly stay with Daniel again."
2818,341388,2011-06-28,711463,Sunny,"Daniel is a very kind, helpful, and nice host. We were amazed at his careful attention at every detail for the guests. Everything was very clean as a nice hotel. The room is so cozy and bright, you can even see a nice little garden from the window. 

We did not plan much for this trip, but on the first night we could perfectly plan out everything with the resources Daniel provided us. All the travel guides and efficient maps are in the room! 

If you a big fan of Thai food, ask Daniel where to go for your first meal in Amsterdam near his place- it was THE BEST. 

Thank you Daniel!!!
Sunny K"
2818,359800,2011-07-08,400176,Sharon,"Daniel is a phenomenal host; he has everything you could need and has an answer for every question we had.  The room is better than the photo and the accomodations were wonderful.  Daniel was great with communication both before and during our stay.  The location has easy access to tram, bus, stores, restaurants, and pubs - all within walking distance. I will definitely stay with Daniel again and I have already recommended his room to family and friends."
2818,369637,2011-07-12,772352,David,"Daniel is an outstanding host. He is extraordinarily organized & tidy. The room was spotless, and the two beds were comfortable. There is quite a lot of space, and a beautiful view of his backyard garden out the bedroom window. It is so nice to open the windows and see greenery and hear the chirping birds. It is an easy 10-15 minute bike ride to Amsterdam Centraal Station, and all the rest that the city has to offer. Highly recommended! I would definitely stay again."
2818,510827,2011-09-07,909454,Yana,"Daniels's place is really fantastic and he was a great host! 

His place is beautifully decorated and very clean and no detail is lost to the make the stay very comfortable for his guests. From the latest cover of ""time out amsterdam"" to color coded towel rack for guests, to the most comfortable beds and pillows, latest travel books,  keys for each guest, his place set a high standard of what Airbnb should be like.

Especially grateful for countless hours Daniel put into helping my travel parner with her lost passport/wallet in another country, and having a converter for my mac.

His home was quiet and peaceful, and he has a lovely garden. The bus is a block away, supermarket 2 blocks away, and a great restaurant Bahnus(?) is 2-3 blocks away, serves very good dinner.

Highly recommend his home for exploring Amsterdam. There is a park  about 20 minutes away that's a must see for a flower lover, it's called Oosterpark and it was delightful!"
2818,515199,2011-09-09,801728,Dominic,"Our stay with Daniel was enjoyable - our only complaint was the non-stop-rain during our visit, and really Daniel could have done nothing about this!"
2818,542894,2011-09-18,1033494,Franziska,"Daniel is a great host, he is very helpful and he can give you any info about amsterdam you need. The room as well as the bathroom and toilet are very clean. Daniel's place is located 1,4 km away from a park+ride, in a nice neighborhood and is really good connected to the city center.  Highly recommended!"
2818,554817,2011-09-21,1119102,Adam,"Daniel was the definition of a fantastic host. His place was impeccable. When we arrived (which was late, and our ETA was changed a few times due to travel woes), our beds were made, clean towels neatly wrapped, soothing music playing, and the smell of fresh eucalyptus/mint filled the air. Overall, a fantastic experience I would recommend to everyone. 

Thanks Daniel!
Adam&Jess"
2818,698543,2011-11-07,62868,Rachel,"Daniel was an absolute dream host. His place is so clean, he is EXTREMELY organized and super sweet. We had such a great time in Amsterdam and Daniel had a major part of that. I can't tell you how much I recommend staying with him! THANKS DANIEL!!!!!!"
2818,825414,2012-01-02,1475799,Dhaval,Daniel is a great host even before reaching AMS he gave us good directions on how to get to his place. Leaving @ Daniels was wonderful. He has a great place in a quiet neighboorhood with easy access to trams and busses to get to the centraal station in 15 mins. On our arrival he shared a lot of good information about places to visit. We had an extra guest at the last minute and he was more than happy to accommodate  him in the living room. AMS is awesome and would definitely like to visit back and would stay @Daniels again :)
2818,1084419,2012-04-04,1315953,Miriam,"We felt very much welcomed at Daniel's place. Very thing is well organized, you are provided with eveything you need, the room is pleasant and Daniel is a sensitive and sensible host. It felt a bit like home :-) "
2818,1194128,2012-04-28,2133939,Christina,"Daniel was a great host! This was our first time staying in a B&B and let's just say he set the bar really high. His home was extremely clean and very well organized. The garden view was so peaceful. Both my bf and myself were sick during our Europe trip and Daniel was kind enough to offer us lozenges for our sore throats. He was also very helpful by providing maps, magazines on things to do and any other advice we needed. The room came equipped with coffee and tea and WiFi. His home is very close to public transportation and getting to central Amsterdam was a breeze. If I ever come back to Amsterdam I would definitely be staying at his place again. "
2818,1437274,2012-06-08,1899497,Fareeha,"I have nothing but praise for this gem of a place. Daniel is an exceptional host- he helped us carry our luggage, poured us juice, and gave us so many useful information that made our stay in Amsterdam truly memorable. The room provided a 5* experience and has everything you would possibly need for your stay. The apartment is tastefully decorated with beautiful artwork that is truly inspiring. If you are in Amsterdam, this is the place you should stay. You won't regret it. :)"
2818,1475433,2012-06-13,963429,Stefanie,"Daniel's is fantastic! 
Great location. Quiet room. Good beds. Fantastic bathroom. Spotlessly clean. Nice host. Fun bikes!
He has thought of everything to make his guests comfortable. We enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam very much thanks to Daniel!
Definitely recommend and would love to go back."
2818,1540158,2012-06-23,2059915,New,"Fun guy, easy to get along with. Good location to see the sights of Barcelona which are many. Enjoyed the dialogue and chatting. Recommended as a great host. "
2818,1594647,2012-06-30,2481566,Amilcar,"I stayed with my partner at Daniel's place for almost a week and we see Daniel as the perfect host. From the first moment he welcomed us in a very kindly, respectful and positive way. He provided us information about many places to go and he was always showing us the best alternatives in Amsterdam. At his home everything is perfectly organized and clean, the room is nice, cozy, comfortably, quiet and is located in a nice neighboorhood and very well connected. Definitively Daniel has done everything as possible to make our stay more enjoyable. The place is perfect and highly recommended."
2818,1872771,2012-08-02,3018525,Luis,"I was most satisfied with my stay in Daniel's place.  It was cozy, clean, and quiet.  Daniel was very helpful in giving directions on how to best get to his place with a bit of luggage.  On getting there he gave me directions on how best to get to do what I wanted in the time I had.  He provided privacy though I knew he was there to provide any help he could if needed.  I would recommend his place to my friends.  His place is in a very convenient and safe area.  I would definitely look into his place if I had another chance to go to Amsterdam. Thanks, Daniel."
2818,2281683,2012-09-14,193685,James & Diane,"Wonderful, quiet and relaxing is the best way to describe Daniels apartment. Plus, Daniel was very accommodating and extremely helpful with directions. I would recommend Daniels apartment to anyone that is looking for a relaxing environment while visiting Amsterdam. "
2818,3657240,2013-02-28,5253122,Sidney,The reservation was canceled 29 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2818,3956289,2013-03-30,5640272,Rustie,"We were very well received and his place was very clean. He's kind and wants you to feel at home. Our only complaint was that we were not made aware of the early morning check out time upon arrival and came home the night before to a note on the door asking us to be out by a certain time. As long as you get all the information and communication from him, you should be fine.

"
2818,4344658,2013-04-29,5787671,Karoline,"My friend and I really enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam - Daniel is so friendly  and hospitable - the greatest example of this was when we were returning to the central station, he rode his bike to give me my tiny earrings which were the only thing I forgot. He also made sure we had coffee and tea in the morning. "
2818,4524630,2013-05-10,6167602,Alexandra,"To describe our stay at Daniel's place in two words: absolutely wonderfull. Not only is Daniel a kind and caring person, but also a very attentive host who kept everything spotless. Although the apartment is close to the city center, we were more than thankfull that he lend us some bike for a real Amsterdam experience. But most of all, we really felt at home. Thank You, Daniel :)"
2818,4569852,2013-05-13,5703225,Shelley,"Daniel was absolutely fantastic! Communication was great and he gave us tons of good Amsterdam tips. He was very accessible, but let us have our space.

The apartment itself is incredibly clean, the room is a good size and very easy access to city center, rijksmuseum, vondelpark, and the train station - a 10 minute bus ride. Great wifi, tea and coffee in the room, this was a home away from home and a great first stop on our journey. This is a wonderful stay for 2 people, and I would definitely stay here again!"
2818,4928557,2013-06-02,1700889,John,"Just spent only three nights staying at Daniel's....wish it could have been a lot more.
If you want to stay at a place that is impeccably clean, organized, and with a great host then Daniel's is the place.  Daniel will do everything to make your stay enjoyable. "
2818,5120220,2013-06-13,758617,Deepak,"Of all the Airbnb places I've stayed at, Daniel has been the most professional host I've come across. Every bit of required information was provided before arrival, and the apartment was very clean and organized. The room looks just like it does in the pictures - well lit and colorful. Only slight problem we faced was a space issue when opening up multiple suitcases in the same room, but we got used to it soon enough. The room also has a mini-refrigerator - which was of great convenience. The neighborhood this apartment is located in is also very nice. Overall, very comfortable stay!"
2818,5282066,2013-06-22,6790170,Billy,"Daniel was a very kind and gracious host. Zeeberg is an interesting area that is a little rundown compared to other parts of Amsterdam but they're obviously working to improve it. Traveling to and from centraal was quick and easy, especially with Daniel's guidance on the transit system. Additionally, how Daniel handled wifi access and the keypads for the apartment was flawless and inventive. "
2818,6798865,2013-08-25,8239676,Frédéric,"Daniel est très hospitalier. Il est amical et fait en sorte que vous passiez un bon séjour chez lui et vous conseille sur la ville.
Son appartement est très propre, très bien rangé.
L'appartement est très bien desservi par les transports.
Mon ami et moi-même avons été très satisfaits de notre séjour passé dans son appartement.
Daniel is very hospitable. He is friendly and makes sure you have a good stay at home and advise you on the town.
His apartment is very clean, very tidy.
The apartment is very well served by public transport.
My friend and I were very satisfied with our stay in his apartment."

Thank´s for your service.
2818,9600146,2014-01-03,10075270,Raphaël,"Super séjour à Amsterdam et ce en partie grâce à notre hébergement de qualité. Daniel est vraiment très aimable, prend soin que vous ayez tout a votre disposition (par exemple nous avons eu la chance d'avoir des vélos de prêts pour les 5 jours sur place ce qui nous a beaucoup simplifié les trajets). La chambre en soi est très mignone, avec, encore une fois, tout ce dont vous pourriez avoir besoin à votre disposition. L'endroit est calme, plaisant, et extrêmement bien tenu! Je recommande à tous ceux qui souhaitent visiter Amsterdam en paix (ou y faire la fête) ce super logement!"
2818,11310196,2014-03-29,6029464,Alejandro,"Daniel is a a very organized and professional host. A lot of information is at the hands of the guest from the very start. Tons of leaflets, magazines and print-outs about things to do in Amsterdam (plus bus routes and timetables) can be found in the room and in the hall of the apartment. The house is extremely clean. There are bus and tram stops nearby, which make it easy to get around the city. I would not hesitate to recommend Daniel to other people that want to stay in Amsterdam."
2818,11753031,2014-04-14,10641872,Farhan,"Daniel is a great host, his place is immaculate and comfortable. Daniel provided my friend and I with all the information we needed and then some. I would recommend Daniel's place to friends and family, no complaints what so ever."
2818,12789427,2014-05-11,12496735,Maneepan,"Daniel is the good host! He provided all necessary information of the trip for us.
His place is so peaceful and cleanses. It is near to tramp and bus station just 2-3 minutes by walk. We feel safe and comfort at Daniel place. "
2818,12934868,2014-05-14,4629258,Sarah,"Daniel was very professional, welcoming and friendly. His apartment is lovely, relaxing and calming. It was impeccable and the beds were so comfortable. I loved staying here. If you go to amsterdam, I highly recommend staying with Daniel. He provided maps and information and thought of everything possible to make my stay in pleasant.  The apartment is situated near to a tram stop so it was easy to get to and from the city center. 
"
2818,13041264,2014-05-18,14368839,Alexa,"Sehr saubere und gepflegte Wohnung. Daniel war sehr hilfsbereit und zuvorkommend. Die Verkehrsanbindung ist super. Man ist in ca. 10 min. am Hauptbahnhof. Ich würde jederzeit wieder bei Daniels übernachten, wenn ich in Amsterdam bin."
2818,14452516,2014-06-19,14891811,Veruzka,"He was a very nice host.  Myself and my fiancee stayed for 3 days in Amsterdam and we had a great time staying with Daniel.  He gave us help of where to go in the city, he rented bikes to us, and he gave us a map that was extremely useful in getting around.  He is very well organized and the whole stay was great and very easy."
2818,14614776,2014-06-23,13154289,Joseph,"We had a amazing stay at Daniel's.  The living space, room, and bathroom facilities are kept immaculate.  The neighborhood is very peaceful, quiet, and extremely well-connected to central Amsterdam, though several eateries and cafes are within a 5-minute walk.   There is also a well-maintained park (Flevopark) at the end of the street servicing nature-lovers and runners.  Last but not least, Daniel is both available, accommodating, and kind.  Do not think twice about this place!!!"
2818,15194300,2014-07-04,17103969,Tabea,Daniel is a very friendly and helpful person. He makes our stay in Amsterdam perfect! I just can advise him. 
2818,15331290,2014-07-07,16246003,Valerio,"Tutto perfetto...

Grazie mille"
2818,15577744,2014-07-12,15548753,Tatiana,"We stayed at Daniel's for 5 nights. His apartment is very quiet and impeccably clean; the bedroom is very nice, exaclty as in the photos (pillows and duvet are very good). Besides, there is a table and a small fridge. The shower (separate from the WC)  is also very good. The apartment is not in the center but you can easily reach it by bus, tram or metro. There are various restaurants, bars and cafés in the area - this is great because you get to know places where tourists usually do not go. 
Daniel is a great host, he provided us with very useful info about transport and things to do in Ams. Our stay was great, we did not have any problem at all in the apartment. I am sure Daniel would provide any further assistance that we may have needed, he really thinks about every tiny thing a tourist may need during his/her stay in Amsterdam. I also wanted to thank him for finding the contact lenses we forgot in the bedroom! Definitely recommend! "
2818,15958467,2014-07-19,15927333,Daniel,Un séjour remarquable !  Daniel est un hôte soucieux du bien- être des gens qu'ils accueillent.  Toujours disponible et fier de partager ses connaissances de sa ville pour faciliter notre séjour.  Un environnement fort jolie et très propre et un décor soigné quoi demander de mieux !
2818,16263344,2014-07-24,17449732,Felix,"We had great time during the stay at Daniel’s home.
We felt like we are home for 4 nights. He was very kind and helpful.
The room was very clean and quite. And there was a garden out of window in the room. In the every morning, when we woke up, we could see the bird’s tweet with the breeze softly. How can the morning be better?
In the night, the curtains block the light completely during sleeping.
Only alarm could interrupt our sleeping.

The bathroom was also VERY clean. The toiletries were all good stuff.
It was filled with the AROMA. Also, It was good to take a shower with good temperature and water pressure.

First of all, His house is always neat and clean. And he knew everything for the trip in Amsterdam. Also, we had a pleasant conversation with him.
Thank you, Daniel."
2818,16408539,2014-07-27,11877341,Kammy,I had a good stay at daniels place which was very clean and functional. It was also very well decorated and Daniel is very friendly and helpful!
2818,16984035,2014-08-05,16393098,Shauna,"Daniel was an excellent host! He greeted my friend and I with open arms, and was a superb resource for us. The personal maps he gave us were so handy! He went above and beyond our expectations when he was able to arrange his schedule to accept my friend's late baggage while we were enjoying the city.  I would recommend Daniel's place to everyone ! It is so close to the city center and the place is incredibly clean and comfortable! I wish we were there longer and I hope to return some day! "
2818,18056471,2014-08-21,16420968,Tina,"Not sure what else can be said about Daniel.  He is a true gentleman and was always ready with any answers (or bandaids) we needed!  His attention to detail made us feel like we were at a 5 star hotel.  The neighborhood has restaurants, bars, markets and even an awesome looking playground!   If we ever make it back to Amsterdam I won't even bother looking for somewhere else to stay!"
2818,19039663,2014-09-05,19858271,Daniel,"My experience in amsterdam was brilliant. From daniels appartment i had close access to buses and/or trams, so getting to the city centre was easy. A simple 5 minute journey.  Daniel as a host was superb, very relaxed atmosphere in his home, and he provided us with lots of information including places to go/see. I recommend daniel as a host full heartedly.  Brilliant time. Til next time!"
2818,20096728,2014-09-23,8700764,Amelia,"Daniel was a very helpful host. Upon arrival he was there to welcome us with cold drinks. He provided us with clear directions and maps of Amsterdam. He made it so easy to explore Amsterdam using public transport. He was always available and happy to answer question. He was friendly and talkative and interested in our days. He was very well organised and the apartment was as pictured and spotlessly clean. The bed were very comfortable. I bought some food without realising that guests don't have access to the kitchen (it is written in the room description), Daniel was very generous and still let me use his kitchen to cook my food. We had a little bit of trouble connecting to the internet in the bedroom (was strong in the lounge room) Daniel gave us a signal booster for the bedroom when we let him know. I would recommend staying with Daniel."
2818,20302184,2014-09-27,10676984,James,"After we arrived Daniel showed us the accommodations and offered us something to drink. We proceeded to talk for the better part of three hours. Daniel is one of the most agreeable and accommodating people I have stayed with through Airbnb. In his apartment are countless books about Amsterdam that one can leaf through. However, if you don't like to read, he can show you places to go and tell you about locales to visit that are not only interesting for tourists but for locals as well. He provides you with numerous maps, so you will never be wanting a reference if you happen to lose your way. It was a warm and informative welcome. 

The accommodations were spectacular. There are ample nooks in which to store your baggage, so what at first appears to be a modestly-sized room for two people with luggage turns out to be rather spacious. The room is equipped with a water heater, instant coffee, and tea, so if the need for a morning pep-up settles upon you, it is right there in your room. Each bed is equipped with a reading lamp and the heater is placed nicely between the heads of the bed. We were never cold. The bathroom and toilet were kept impeccably clean and the towels were washed when we needed them. The orchids throughout the apartment were also very beautiful, and when we wanted some fresh air we needed only to open the window to the garden that is situated between the beds. 

The location of the apartment should suit those who want quick access to the city center without the bustle and noise. If one wishes to go by foot, one can get to the many attractions old city in about 30-45 minutes, depending on how fast one walks. It is an enjoyable city to walk in: very flat, organized, neighborhood markets everyday, different languages and cultures always surrounding you. The apartment itself is in a primarily non-native-Dutch neighborhood, so you're exposed from the get-go to the nice mix of cultures that Amsterdam harbors. The area is quiet but active. Staying here, one also experiences the everyday life of Amsterdam and avoids an environment overly saturated with tourists. There is a school, many shops for locals, and a playground for children in the vicinity. Flevo Park is about a five-minute walk from the apartment, which is nice if you want to spend an afternoon among the storks, swans, and sandy soil upon which Amsterdam is rooted.  

To the host himself: Daniel is helpful. He makes sure you are comfortable and is always open to questions and offering suggestions. He takes care of without meddling over you. You could talk to him not only about Amsterdam but many things: the art in his apartment, the furniture, films, etc. We had no complaints and were very happy to have stayed there. If you wish to visit Amsterdam but avoid the bustle, this is where you should stay."
2818,20503978,2014-09-30,19381082,Anna,"Daniel was a great host, very attentive and prudent. His appartement was just as shown in the photos, very homely and clean and it smelled very nice and fresh. Hence we really enjoyed staying with him. 


After booking he sent us a nice email with lots of information and responded quickly to our questions.

When we arrived in Amsterdam, we got a phone call from Daniel making sure we found his place okay. He is a calm, very friendly person who is fluent in English. 

Upon arriving in Niasstraat, Anna and I realised that we didn’t know his last name, so we were worried, if we’d find his doorbell. To our surprise, he put his first name on the doorbell which is smart and gives him the benefit of a little more anonymity. 

We were greeted by Daniel at the door who invited us in and offered us something to drink. We were sitting in his living room, which is decorated with African wooden figures, listening to the Pachelbel canon. 
He gave us lots of valuable information, including various maps (public transport, of the neighborhood and whole city), aswell as bus and tram schedules. 

You could tell from every detail that Daniel handles his hosting very professionally: he has a door lock with a key code, which he individually changes for every guest. His WiFi passwort was also changed specifically for our stay. We were positively surprised! 
For security reasons, he also installed an infrared webcam in his hallway, which is okay but he forgot to mention it.

After that he gave us the tour of his appartement. It’s a cozy, very tidy place with a guest room looking at the garden.
There are two beds, on top of each layed two rolled-up towels. They were color-marked red and orange respectively, so we would not confuse them in the bathroom. Another smart detail. 
The room had all the extras as described and seen in the photographs. Daniel cleaned the dishes for us after every time we made tea and also cleaned our waste basket every day. 
WiFi reception was not the best in the bedroom (we used two Android smartphones). Enough for (Hidden by Airbnb) , but not enough for watching YouTube clips. A WiFi repeater in the room would be a good solution to this problem. 

After this he showed us the bathroom. I was amused by a small homo-erotic piece of art attached to the bathroom door. The bathroom, like the rest of the appartment, was very clean, with a nice shower, space for toiletries on the washing machine and color-marked towel bars. The toilet was not in the bathroom, but an own seperate room.


We can highly recommend @Daniel's and if we'll be visting Amsterdam again we would try to stay with him again.


Hartstikke bedankt Daniel!"
2818,20832438,2014-10-06,20565927,Andi,"Staying at Daniel's place was as enjoyable as one could imagine. He welcomed us very kindly, showed us around and offered cold drinks. Then he already provided us with useful pieces of information.
The room is absolutely cosy and offers everything one would need. The beds are very comfortable und it's a rather quiet neighbourhood. He provided towels and linen and the whole flat was very tidy.
His daily weather forecast was not only useful but more so very accurate.
I would stay at his place again anytime. Highly recommended."
2818,21059309,2014-10-10,12213592,Susanne,"Daniel ist sehr zuvorkommend und denkt an alles! Er macht es dir leicht, dich willkommen zu fühlen und hilft wo er kann, um den Aufenthalt in Amsterdam zu genießen. Ich habe gut geschlafen, es war sehr sauber und ordentlich und ich habe einfach nichts, aber auch gar nichts zu beanstanden. Wenn Daniel gekonnt hätte, hätte er bestimmt auch gerne für besseres Wetter gesorgt! Ein total netter Gastgeber! Ich komme gerne wieder..."
2818,21292853,2014-10-14,20989264,Jonathan,Daniel was a great host. He gave us very detailed directions to his place and upon our arrival he provided us with maps and places to visit in amsterdam. The room was very neat and tidy. We were also provided with clean towels. Daniel's place also has easy public transport to get around. Daniel was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Highly recommended.
2818,21480086,2014-10-18,6488881,Aashay,"Daniel's place is amazing and he does an incredible job with hospitality. Everything was incredibly clean and he pretty much thought of everything (it was like staying in a little hotel inside his apartment). He was also very responsive when it came to any issues (had some issues with the wifi the first day and he took care of it right away). If you're looking for a great place to stay away from all the tourist rabble, I highly suggest Daniel's place. "
2818,21664685,2014-10-21,13195901,Doruk,Daniel was a great host. He had prepared anything we might need during our stay. He was also very professional and his phone was always open in case we needed to contact him. The flat was very clean and tidy and the beds were comfortable. I would definitely recommend staying here.
2818,21787755,2014-10-24,21388205,Tuan,Daniel is nice. It was fun. 
2818,22033157,2014-10-28,4592146,AmBer,"Daniel was an incredible host. The room looked exactly how it does in the picture. He was incredibly helpful, and supplied any and everything we needed. 
His neighborhood is lovely and close to bus routes that go directly to the towns center. I would stay here each time  I revisit Amsterdam, and I'd recommend anyone I know to do the same. "
2818,23174233,2014-11-24,533940,Victor,"A really great Airbnb experience with Daniel. He was very friendly and helpful. The room is very nice and clean. Got everything we need. 

This was a just short trip to catch up with my friend from overseas and both of us didn't spend too much time to plan the trip beforehand. But with Daniel's advice we did manage to have some great time in Amsterdam. "
2818,24206321,2014-12-22,13546702,Florian,Daniel was a wonderful host and the room was just as described/pictured.  He was able to provide good recommendations for what to do and had available things that travels need but tend to forget.  We rented bikes (for a small additional daily fee) -- that were in great condition and included everything we needed to be able to lock them up and ride safely at night -- and we found them to be a great way to get to know Amsterdam quickly and efficiently.  The neighborhood is very nice and it's easy to get to the heart of Amsterdam by bus or bike.  Highly recommended.
2818,24688179,2015-01-01,7992090,Alma,"I had a really wonderful stay at Daniel's. Daniel went above and beyond what I would expect from a host. The place is impeccable, comfortable and a really great to stay for a few days in Amsterdam! I absolutely recommend staying with him."
2818,25046545,2015-01-05,24755577,Laia,"Esta ha sido nuestra primera experiencia con Airbnb y la verdad, no hemos podido hacer mejor elección. Daniel es un encanto de persona hemos estado muy cómodas, cuida el mínimo detalle para hacerte sentir 100% como en casa. Aparte de ser una persona encantadora es muy servicial y en todo momento nos facilitó todo tipo de información necesaria para nuestro viaje sea del tipo que sea. Es muy atento y le puedes pedir cualquier cosa, la verdad es que cuida mucho a sus huéspedes y hace que te lleves un gran recuerdo de su casa y de la ciudad, que, por cierto, ánimo a todo el mundo a visitarla.
Por otro lado, comentar también que las fotos de la habitación son tal cual,es decir, no te llevas ningún tipo de desengaño tema foto vs realidad.
Desde aquí aprovecho para mandarle un saludo a Daniel.
Muchísimas gracias por todo.
Laia"
2818,25881134,2015-01-28,25399998,Taylor,"Daniel's home was beautiful!  It is just as pictured!  His home was very clean and neat!  As soon as we arrived, Daniel showed us around his home and we had a cup of tea.  He told us everything we needed to know and let us ask him any questions we had!! His home is very organized and was color-coordinated as far as towels and bathroom items!  He had bikes for us to rent (13 euro first day, 7 euro each day after) and they were great!! We got to see the city as the locals do and biking was so much fun!! It's difficult to get used to if you don't bike everyday, but it was so much fun! And Daniel told us everything we needed to know about biking in he city! Daniel's home is a 10 minute bike ride into the city which is perfect for any tourist wanting to see the city and an average Dutch neighborhood!  Our stay was short, 3 nights, but Daniel made us feel at home and we loved our cozy beds to crawl into at night! I would definitely stay here again! Daniel and his home were perfect! "

2818,26748548,2015-02-18,25733503,Emilie,"We had a great stay at Daniel's.

The room is exactly as described. Everything was spot clean, we were provided with several bath towels, plenty of storage room, and multiple guidebooks and maps of the city.

Daniel was a great host, very eager to help and always available a text message away when he wasn't home. 

Definitely recommend staying at his place. The location is great too with the city centre only a short bus trip or cycle ride away !"
2818,27163384,2015-02-27,3321930,Jörg,Daniels Unterkunft ist ein perfekter Ort um in Amsterdam zu übernachten. Die Anbindung mit Bus und Bahn ist perfekt. Man kann auch zu Fuß die Innenstadt gut erreichen und auf dem Weg gibt es einiges zu entdecken. Die Betten sind gemütlich und die Wohnung geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Daniel hatte gute Tipps für uns und ist ein sehr angenehmer Zeitgenosse. Mein persönlicher Tipp ist das Thai Restaurant in der Javastraat um die Ecke. Nächstes mal in Amsterdam bin ich gerne wieder Gast dort. Thank's for the time at your place. See you next time. Peace. 
2818,28343101,2015-03-22,17837628,Sophie,"We had a lovely stay in Daniel's home. He made us feel very welcome and was very happy to help, giving us ideas of places to visit or answering any questions we had. He gave us a map which helped us easily find public transport into the city centre.

2818,28540642,2015-03-25,28712303,Sheldon,My stay at Daniel was good. He did a great job of staying in contact with through all my traveling delays. Daniel's place is a about a 12 minute bus ride away from Central Amsterdam. The place is very clean and quiet. The only thing missing would be television in the room. If you are looking to enjoy and explore Amsterdam this is a good place. 
2818,29497034,2015-04-08,25907928,Nadia,"This was my first time using airbnb and it was a great experience.  I cannot recommend Daniel enough, he was so accommodating, he went out of his way to get the answers to our questions, it was very convenient that he had his own bikes for us to rent. He messaged me all the time to make sure I was ok and would also give a prompt reply if I asked him a question. The place was very clean and looks exactly the same as the pictures.  I highly recommend daniel and would defiantly stay here on my next trip to amsterdam.   Thank you for a pleasant stay daniel."

2818,31590351,2015-05-07,28987927,Ti,"Staying at Daniel's was great. He welcomed us with a beer, gave us all the info we needed, his apartment was spotless clean and most important, he has two bikes that you can rent. And when in Amsterdam having a bike is a must have. We had a great time in Amsterdam and at Daniel's.

2818,32967920,2015-05-24,19020174,Stephen,"Daniel was incredibly welcoming and ensured that all and any concerns I had were met immediately with rectification. I would say generally, he went above and beyond the call of duty.

The apartment was well situated in terms of public transport links and is walking distance (with good shoes) from the city.

Would definitely recommend staying at Daniel's"
2818,33353330,2015-05-27,10515603,Eleanor,"We had a wonderful experience @ Daniel's. Daniel was the perfect host - friendly, attentive and always available. He provided us with a much appreciated glass of water on arrival after taking our bags, and gave us a debrief on accessing the city via public transport. He provided us with maps to use for the buses as well as for the bikes (if you have the chance to utilise the bikes available for hire, definitely do so! You won't regret it!). The public transport is very easy to use - roughly a 5 minute walk to the bus stop and a 12 minute bus ride into the city. We had no trouble getting anywhere. Daniel was sure to check in with us over the few days that we stayed to see if we were okay and if we needed anything. The room was well serviced. He looked after us so well. Thank you Daniel!"
2818,33581423,2015-05-30,30524482,Karlheinz,Nice and quite room located in a gentrified area of Amsterdam apart from the touristic hot spots. I really enjoyed my stay not at least due to the charming host.
2818,33984656,2015-06-03,28738000,Elena,"L'appartamento è molto pulito. Daniel è molto accogliente, attento ad ogni esigenza dei suoi ospiti. Ci ha dato cartine e indicazioni utili al nostro soggiono. Molto comodo il noleggio delle biciclette direttamente da lui: il centro è raggiungibile in 10,15 minuti. Daniel è sempre reperibile al telefono per qualsiasi informazione e, quando è in casa, sempre disponibile per due chiacchiere e una birra...
The room is very cosy, with everything you need, and the area of the flat is  quiet and within easy reach from the city center. Renting the bikes from Daniel is great because  you can start using them as soon as you arrive. Daniel is discreet but welcoming, and you can rely on him if you need any updated information regarding what's going on in Amsterdam. Great stay, indeed. 
"
2818,34529146,2015-06-09,30289149,Bernhard,"Our stay at Daniel's was really, really comfortable and very friendly - as often mentioned: the perfect host! Good information in advance made it a breeze to find the location. We had warmly welcome with a can of beer and Daniel provided us with lots of useful information (ideas, maps, tipps, how to use public transport, P&R, ...) about Amsterdam and made it easy for us to get a good start for our city trip.  He also was always at hand, when we needed some help. The rooms are very clean, you got everything you need for a good stay, and you even can borrow two bikes from Daniel. Like this, we could experience the city like we were living there - by bike. If we were going there once again, we know where to stay ;)"
2818,35099940,2015-06-15,6164576,Ben,Daniel is a great host. The apt is clean and in a nice neighborhood. I was able to run in a very nice park a couple of blocks away. You cannot walk down to the tourist part of town from his area but there is a bus close by that will get you there. I recommend Daniels Airbnb.
2818,35452857,2015-06-19,29294505,Jan,"Daniel was the perfect host. Great instructions on how to get there, and he met me at the door with a big smile. Accommodation was immaculately clean, and Daniel was attentive to any needs I may have had.  His attention to detail is quite remarkable. Along with that, and his thorough knowledge of the area, it was a very enjoyable stay.  Thanks Daniel."

2818,38493072,2015-07-16,32161750,Lorena And Felipe,"Daniel è una persona estremamente gentile. L'accoglienza è stata molto buona. Ci ha fornito mappe della città, indicazioni ed è estremamente disponibile in caso di qualsiasi necessità. La stanza era in perfetto ordine, pulita e profumata e non ci è mancato niente. Che dire Amsterdam è una bellissima città e per quanto riguarda la nostra esperienza anche le persone sono molto gentili! 
Il quartiere è carino, servito da mezzi che in pochi minuti ti portano nel centro. Infine un'ottima esperienza!!!"
2818,40093760,2015-07-28,11275359,AnnMarie,Daniel is a fantastic host and so are his cozy quarters. He welcomes you with a beverage and maps with detailed information to make your stay a pleasant one. His home is clean and very well equipped. He makes every effort to keep in touch with you when a question my arise. The nieghborhood is not in the centeral part of Amsterdam but public transport is no problem. The nieghborhood is quiet and has nice cafes in the surrounding area. Loved my time there. 
2818,40592719,2015-08-01,17293453,Dennis,Daniel was a great host. He welcomed us into his home and gave us a plethora of information about the town and how to get around. He was very available for questions and incredibly nice. We were looking for a relaxing stay so we mostly kept to ourselves and he seemed to respect that as well but I got the idea that he would have been very sociable if that is the kind of stay you are interested in.
2818,42521115,2015-08-14,33350700,Laetitia,"L'accueil est très chaleureux et agréable. Daniel est gentil et aux petits soins. La chambre est très propre et bien décorée. On se sent bien chez lui. On se sent en sécurité dans le quartier, tout a été parfait ! Je le recommande.

Il nous a donner plusieurs idées et moyens pratiques pour nous déplacer, nous avons beaucoup apprécié ce logement, quartier bien situé, ni trop près ni trop loin du centre d'Amsterdam ! Et accès rapide à vélos, loués directement chez l'hôte, une très bonne expérience! Nous le remercions pour ce séjour !"

Daniel ist sehr angenehm, ein sehr netter Gastgeber. Er hat uns viele Tipps gegeben, war immer sehr hilfsbereit. Wenn er nicht persönlich für Fragen da war konnten wir ihn mobil erreichen - er meldete sich immer umgehend.
Die Wohnung ist sehr schön eingerichtet, alles picobello sauber.
Die Anbindung mit dem Bus bzw. mit der Straßenbahn ist super.
Falls wir nochmals nach Amsterdam fahren, dann wieder zu Daniel!"
2818,45471019,2015-09-03,2537590,Stuart,Although I came late he took time from work to meet and to brief me. Competent and clean. 
2818,46271841,2015-09-09,25665174,Ron,"Daniel is the perfect host - warm, welcoming, and helpful. The moment I stepped into his flat, he sat me down, offered me a drink, and then went over Amsterdam's public transit system and potential sightseeing suggestions. Daniel also made sure to check up on how I am doing throughout my trip - when we had issues communicating by text, he continued to keep in touch via email, which is much appreciated. 

The accommodations are as advertised. The room is cosy and looks out on Daniel's carefully cultivated garden. The lavatory and bathroom, which are separate, are exceptionally clean. The flat itself has close access to the public transit system should you opt not to ride a bike in Amsterdam. All in all, Daniel's flat is the perfect place to rest after a long day of sightseeing in Amsterdam. Highly recommended."
2818,47034916,2015-09-15,32431176,Esther,"I found the facility exactly as it is published. My stay was comfortable. Quite room, clean bathroom and I was allowed to use the living. He has really made it to me very easy with explaning everything I Needed during my stay in Amsterdam. Daniel's facility is located very good and one can reach most of the places using the public transportations at any time. I would like to extend my thanks to Daniel's person for his kindness, helping me when I Need help and caring about me. When I'll be in Amsterdam in the future I'll stay at his home. So I'll also recommend everyone of my friends and relatives to go there.  And last but not least; I wish that all Air B&B Provider can treat their guests as Daniel did with me.  "

A plus !!"

Das Zimmer war modern und komfortabel eingerichtet, super für einen kurzen Städtetripp. Besonders ausgefallen ist die Sauberkeit und die tolle Organisation von Daniel. Die Anbindung zur Innenstadt war angenehm und mit einem Tagesticket auch nicht zu teuer. Die Nachbarschaft ist eher ruhig, es gibt aber alle Geschäfte des täglichen Bedarfs. Wir kommen gerne wieder!"

Daniel is a very friendly host as he has a plethora of information about the city and is very responsive to email if there need be a problem. Even allowed an extra guest on our last nights stay without a charge or compliant. Would recommend his place anytime. "
2818,52624992,2015-10-31,46397401,Zheng Wei,"Daniel is a great host. On our arrival he prepared every kind of information for us, there's nothing he doesn't know about Amsterdam and even provided us with bikes. He has travelled a lot, it may be very interesting to hear some of his stories : )"

2818,53269669,2015-11-07,13310386,Jefferson,"Daniel made me feel very welcome from the very beginning, offering me a drink and a detailed overview of the city. He's a great guy and this apartment is very well decorated and spotless. He definitely has an eye for design. Daniel was very helpful. He answered every question I had, gave me extra blankets when I requested them, and even helped me hang my laundry!

The shower and bathroom are wonderful and close to the room you'd be staying at.

This listing is in Indische Buurt, which is a bit out of the way from everything else, but public transportation is fairly straightforward. The street itself is dark, but there weren't any instances where I felt unsafe. There are a few excellent restaurants within a 5 minute walk of the property.

Overall a great value and I really enjoyed my stay here!"

2818,68439590,2016-04-05,5580754,Eddie,"If I were going to become an Airbnb host, I would template as closely as possible Daniel's approach. I like the location, it adds to the experience of feeling local vs tourists. The city is an enjoyable walk and with Daniel's map easy tram and bus routes to an from everywhere.  His advice is spot on and as he listens to your interest books magically appear in your room.  The noise from the other residents is non existent.  The design and build obviously intended it this way.  Only noise on my stay were the birds outside my windows which if you weren't paying attention, you'd not even notice.  I plan on returning multiple times in the future to Daniel's.  "
2818,69227927,2016-04-10,58962573,Karin,"Daniel's var et godt eksempel på min forestilling om, hvornår et b&b bør fungere. Venlig modtagelse, god glidning om byen og seværdigheder. Pænt og rent overalt. Gode toilet og næstformand. Roligt kvarter tæt på transportmuligheder ind til centrum. Jeg følte mig meget velkommen.

I was well rested for each day's adventure. Daniel offered me some suggestions that were highlights of my time, including the Keukenhof gardens and the EYE Film Institute where I saw art films that would not be screened in my home town. I relied on his tour map (linking public transportation to main sights) more than my travel guide.  Daniel supplied me with electric water heater in my room so I could consume tea/coffee at my leisure, added some of my laundry to his own, showed me how to use (Hidden by Airbnb) map in real time and supplied me with a lanyard with his phone number (which I never used but was reassuring to have.

We felt immediately comfortable and welcomed, and confident that, during our three day visit, if we had any questions, Daniel would be there to help us. Indeed, on our first day, he emailed to check we were okay! We can't recommend Daniel highly enough!"

Daniel's apartment was cosy and extremely clean - I really appreciate how he took pride in the little details, such as allocating space for us to hang our bath towels and clearing our trash every day. It might be a little far to walk to the city centre but we rented bikes from him and also took the bus on the other days so it wasn't a problem. "

Sehenswürdigkeiten und Essen geben und war immer offen für unsere Fragen. Auch konnten wir gute Stadträder bei ihm kostengünstig leihen und direkt die Stadt erkunden. Werden bei Gelegenheit gerne wieder kommen!

I was super lucky to have found Daniel as my first airbnb experience but it's a shame to be so spoiled with his hospitality you rarely find genuine chareaterstics as of Daniels! He goes above and beyond all expectations. And like I told him myself I look up to such secure cleanthiness and warmth of heart!!
2818,93329396,2016-08-12,29802439,Andrew,Daniel was quick in reply to my initial booking request and provided further information about Amsterdam upon approving my request.

2818,101164053,2016-09-12,49335486,Bala Murali,"Everything was exactly as described in Airbnb website. A cozy and clean room, comfortable bed and good safety measures. A very quiet place to sleep and recharge the phone. Excellent Wifi speed. We found everything in his house was neat and Daniel has the eye for perfection and attention to details. Very well kept garden at the back of the house, immaculate clean toilet and shower.

Daniel gives you plenty of privacy and also is helpful should you need anything. This is a perfect place for someone busy who needs to feel at home after a long day at conference. Very informative guide provided by Daniel, ideal for first time visitors to Amsterdam. Very good neighborhood.

We found it an easy walk to the bus stops and tram stops and not far from the bars and restaurant. It is ideal location for us to go to RAI and also central via Rembrandt Square and Dam Square.

We really enjoyed our stay. Thank you Daniel."
2818,102834828,2016-09-19,91002807,Yueyang,"这一次的Airbnb体验,我真的没法挑剔,于是给了Daniel全部五星｡本来他是金牌房东,网上无一评价都超赞,我自己以前住过金牌房东的经历也很不错,于是我对他期待已经很高了,但最后Daniel和他的房间还是超出了我的预计!首先,房间非常干净｡主客都是脱鞋进屋,而地板确实一尘不染,让人也不忍破坏这种洁净｡其次,物品整齐有序,一应俱全,质量很好,比如床垫和枕头,比自家的还舒服;他连小音响都准备了,可以连接手机播放音乐｡再有房间设计和装饰风格我很喜欢,整体面积虽不大,但经他的设计,显得宽敞舒适,别具心裁,装饰和椅子都是他从其他国家运回来的,家里到处是植物,生机勃勃｡最后是他特别仔细贴心,他自制了地图和骑行指南,给我们解释时非常耐心,还准备了下午茶招待我们,是个很能聊的人,我最后很遗憾没能跟他交谈更多｡他推荐的景点和餐厅也很棒｡他房内还有很多惊喜,不剧透了,等你们去体验｡I would say Daniel and his house is awesome and beyond my expectation (even though I actually had quite high an anticipation), considering its flawless cleanness, elaborate decoration (combine with European and African), well-equipped room and his comprehensive guide, friendly and supportive manner. Everything seems perfect and staying in his house really made our journey more memorable. Those detailed surprises shall be revealed by the next lucky ones. Overall, 100% recommended."

2818,115891219,2016-11-27,57460462,Jessica,"Daniel was one of the best Airbnb hosts I have ever had. He communicated with us prior to and during our visit, providing tips on how to navigate the area and even events happening the weekend we were in Amsterdam. Immediately upon arrival, he provided us with maps and useful brochures. The apartment was extremely clean and the room looked exactly like the pictures. Daniel even let us leave our luggage at the apartment on the day of checkout since our plane was departing later in the evening. Would 100% reccomend staying in Daniel's home!!!"

2818,137042853,2017-03-13,42356044,Sophie,"Daniel was amazing. The whole trip was great! From offering us a drink (and nibbles!) upon arrival to sending travel tips for trains AFTER we'd left for the airport, and everything in between, he was the perfect host. I had some issues with the bike we rented from him (I'm very short!!!) and he had got his tools out and adjusted the bike for me before I had even woken up on day 2. Just brilliant. Also, the house was impeccably clean!! A lovely, friendly and very easy-to-talk to man. Thank you so much, Daniel :) "
2818,140174246,2017-03-28,68398465,Jeremiah,Daniel was an absolutely fantastic host. The first day he welcomed us in and provided information and suggestions on things to do around the city. I would highly recommend staying with Daniel for anyone traveling to Amsterdam.

The apartment was very clean and I appreciated his welcoming note and vase of tulips. I felt comfortable  as a mature person travelling alone in this neighbourhood which is walking distance to restaurants, laundrettes and a supermarket. Daniel is great host.

2818,158529822,2017-06-07,64367573,Julio,"Daniel is an extremely pleasant person - an experienced traveller  himself. His room and service area (bathroom and toilets) are probably  the cleaner on thus planet- I really plan to indicate his name for the Nobel Prize, if the Sweddish Academy opens an airb&b competition... Serioysly now - we enjoyed his place a lot. The mattress of his bed is unbelievable - so confortable (I never trusted soft matresses- my back is very senstive). Riding a bike one can easily reach the central area within 20-30 min depending on your energy and wind factor. Thre is a nice park nearby (7 min). We had a fantastic spring wheather most if the time  (3/4 d) which obviously makes a difference. In two occasions we returned home at 1:15 am - it was safe and  fun.  If you are less lucky and must face cold  rain, the tram and bus are not too far, but you need a strong umbrella (Daniel will provide you if required). In summary - Enjoy his room because Amsterdam (with sun) is an urban paradise. Daniel is a privileged man..."

384909,12869998,2014-05-12,6168873,Brandon,"Fantastic location, fantastic host, and beautiful apartment.  Lisanne was a very accommodating host, providing some great recommendations for food in the area along with a guidebook of other things to do.

Her apartment is beautiful -- a perfect one bedroom apartment, modernly decorated and furnished, with a fantastic private roof-deck directly accessible from the apartment (see the spiral stairs in the apartment photos).

And the apartment's location right in Jordaan was great -- easy access to trams and buses, easily within walking distance of the more touristy area but still a nice, quiet neighborhood feel."
384909,13196092,2014-05-21,15106768,Ellora,"Lisanne was an absolutely lovely host. She was so genuine and helpful. She even gave us her homemade guidebook and offered to book us a reservation at a restaurant in case we wouldn't have time to do so before arriving in Amsterdam. Her apartment was beautiful, artistically decorated, and full of light and space. The roof top terrace was to die for. I could hardly leave it to go out in the afternoon. If i could I would move the apartment to California so i could live in it myself! But its much better in Amsterdam :) I highly recommend this place! "
384909,15824094,2014-07-16,13976190,Daniel,"Lisanne made us feel completely welcome, from the pre-departure communication to the warm welcome upon our arrival at her place.  She patiently answered our questions and came over during our stay to trouble shoot a problem.  Excellent."
384909,16157620,2014-07-22,15619805,Max,"Lisanne and her apt made this a stay to remember. --- She is an excellent host that will meet you on-time and show you the ropes of the city (via recommendations, numerous maps, educational materials, tour information, etc). --- Because she works in the Amsterdam culinary scene herself, you should most definitely follow-up on her restaurant suggestions. She was spot-on when it came to a # of places. --- With regards to the apartment, it is an easy sell. The location can't be beat. While it is in walking/riding proximity to most everything you might want to see in Amsterdam (especially the many great cafes, coffeeshops, etc. of the Jordaan), it is on a quiet side street where you won't be bothered by the Stag Night type of crowds that tend to frequent the main canals. --- As many other reviewers have shared, the apartment is to die for. If you're lucky enough to catch the city when the sun is out, you'll make lifelong memories up on the roof deck, where you can hear the bells of Westerkerk and see the vast majority of this corner of the city. Also, if you're a guest here, you'll inevitably get a bit of furnishing envy. Lisanne put a lot of time into her place and it shows. --- Zero complaints. Heaps of praise.      

"
384909,16507078,2014-07-28,1376288,Katie,"Lisanne greeted us and showed us around the apartment brilliantly!
The location is wonderful, nice walk to central and around the canals. Great roof terrace and views, lots of space to lounge and eat and bed big and comfortable. Lovely cafe on the end of street and beautiful neighbourhood. Highly recommend."
384909,17225387,2014-08-09,15274557,David,"We had a great three nights at Lisanne's apartment. It has all you could need for a great time in the great city that is Amsterdam, it comes as advertised, with the roof terrace on a warm evening a particular pleasure. Lisanne was excellent to communicate with, and checking in and out was done without any problems. We did have builders renovating the apartment downstairs making a bit of noise on one of our days, but as we were out and about in the city it was not too much of a problem, and the work is now done anyway so is unlikely to affect anyone in the future. Just note if you are looking for the cutlery in the kitchen, it's hidden in a secret draw at the top of the big drawer under the gas stove, but it is definitely there to use! The apartment is centrally located and you can eat and drink in great places nearby. Hiring bikes from Bike City around the corner offers the best transport option for enjoying Amsterdam and its environs, and we had a great day riding north of the city. All in all, you can't go wrong with this place. "
384909,17375951,2014-08-11,4586437,Diego,"Lisanne apartment is a great option for those looking for an accommodation in Amsterdam. It's spacious and comfortable.

I highly recommend."

Il est très bien situé dans Jordaan, quartier calme et très sympathique, un peu à l'écart de l’effervescence du centre ville.

En résumé tout s'est très bien déroulé et nous ne pouvons que conseiller cet appartement pour votre séjour à Amsterdam. "
384909,21209782,2014-10-13,339429,Camilla,"Nice apartement at perfect location. Lisanne was very helpful with different kinds of details; ex making a reservation at a really good restaurant for us, leaving the keys to be picked up at a bar, explaining how to turn up the heating in the apartmnet when it got Cold etc. It made us fell welcome!"
384909,22313375,2014-11-03,16894969,Gonzague,"Lisanne welcome us very well with a guide book and all the activities we can make in the neighbourhood.

It was exactly what we expected: tastefully decorated, with plenty of space for 2 people and a very comfortable bed. The location was also perfect. We were there for NYE and the fireworks from the rooftop were incredible! Lisanne left us good restaurant and bars recommendations and we really enjoyed the ones we tried. Communication with Lisanne before check-in was easy and made things smooth. We hope to meet her in person next time we're in Amsterdam, I'm sure we'd get along! "
384909,26332959,2015-02-09,6233112,Corey,"Really nice place! Great location with easy access to the 13 and 17 trams. Nice canal walking areas with cool little bars and cafes one block away up the street that the apartment is located on. We wanted a weekend getaway from the craziness of Paris work weeks. We found the place designed very well and provided all the needs we wanted. I will rent here again for sure.

The flat is nice. Well decorated and with a homey feeling to it. Perfect for a couple but no more.
Didn't meet with Lisanne - but very helpful throughout."
384909,27001990,2015-02-23,17202240,Sarah,What a great apartment - lovely location int he Jordaan (best district in Amsterdam) with great cafés and bars nearby and just 2 steps from the Anne Frank house and Prinsengracht. The rooftop terrace offers lovely views of the city and the spacious apartment is ideal. Lisanne's tips were especially helpful and we really felt welcome in her home!

The neighborhood is great and friendly with lots of little boutiques and delicious restaurants! On the day we were supposed to leave, Lisanne  let us stay for a couple of extra hours to go to breakfast at a restaurant that she recommended and even worked to get a reservation for us. Each and every time I texted or emailed with a question, she responded within 5 minutes and was always very hospitable. We would try to stay here again if it was available when we're back in town."
384909,53772430,2015-11-12,41222063,Brian,Lisanne was a very good host. We did not meet her because she was out of town but she made it very easy to pick up the keys and answered any questions we had in a timely manner. Her place is full of interesting things to look at and is in a very cool neighborhood. 
384909,54143602,2015-11-16,46174883,Megan,"We absolutely loved Lisanne's gorgeous bohemian apartment! It's a great size for two and the location is perfect. About 20 min walk (or 10 min tram) from the centrum and it's a pleasant walk provided it's not raining! The area of jordaan is great too and well worth exploring. Lisanne as a host was fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble and she got back to any query we had within hours - from breakfast recommendations to hair salons! (where, by the way, we got the best blow dry ahead of a evening out!) We can't recommend this place enough. Thanks again Lisanne for a wonderful weekend in your amazing city x"
384909,55998534,2015-12-07,36472453,Wyatt,"Cool place in a good area. 
Some great local pubs nearby that aren't as touristy. Within a short walk of the touristy stuff if that's what you want. Lisanne is really easy to work with. TV remote was broken... everything else was as described and shown. Nice rooftop patio. Definitely not for anyone that find steep stairs challenging. Would stay here again. "

384909,61070588,2016-01-31,12543669,Eleanor,"Our stay at Lisanne's flat was great. The place is beautifully decorated and in a great location not too far from everything you would want to see in Amsterdam. Lisanne made it easy to pick up the keys, and when there was a hiccup in that plan she was very easy to get ahold of and resolved the issue right away. The only thing I would mention is that when we arrived, there was a full trash bin, little to no toilet paper, the toilet brush still in the toilet, and wet laundry in the washing machine... This listing requires you to pay a cleaning fee, so if you have to pay for the place to be nice and clean for the next guest, it would have been nice for it to be totally clean for our stay. But all in all, a great stay!"
384909,61333888,2016-02-02,21535236,Yiyi,Lisanne is such a lovely landlord. I literally love the way she decorates her apartment. It's very lovely and cozy. Where she lives is pretty much close to everything. Quite area and a nice neighborhood :) 
384909,69571543,2016-04-11,36606015,Marius,"The experience at Lisanne's was a good one but only because of positive vibes. The place was in a great location where you could get to Central Station by foot if needed (or trolly). or walk about Jordaan. It was the perfect mixture between all of the touristy stuff Amsterdam has to offer but also a local side which most people dont get to experience which is a bit more open, relaxed and less stressful.

One issue I had with my stay was when we arrived the place was not cleaned at all. We had to replace the bed sheets on our own which was a huge inconvenience after traveling to Amsterdam, there was trash in the can and the place was dirty. "

Son appartement est spacieux, lumineux, calme et décoré avec énormément de style et de goût ! Le roof top est le petit plus qui fait tout son effet et qui permet de passer un moment agréable pour l'apéro ou le petit déjeuner avec la superbe vue sur les toits de Joordan. L'emplacement de cet appartement est idéal pour profiter pleinement du centre d'Amsterdam, tout est accessible à pied ou à vélo et le quartier de Joordan est super pour profiter des bars sur les canaux, des restaurants chaleureux qui proposent qui plus est de la très bonne cuisine !

Lisanne had provided an extremely useful guide - especially restaurant and cafe recommendations.
The Joordan is a great part of Amsterdam to stay in walkable distance to most places we wanted to visit. 
Would thoroughly recommend this apartment."

The place is super cool and filled with Buddhas, amazing textiles from around he world, good books, sound system, crystals and good vibes.  The terrace above is the perfect place to chill or meditate too!  It is set up with bamboo planters, Tibetan prayer flags, patio furniture and a hammock!  We had everything we needed and enjoyed an entire week at her place. 

Lisanne is super fast at responding to anything. You need and cares about all her guest.

I highly recommend her place!

384909,104046320,2016-09-25,61042665,Neil,Lisanna's apartment was great and perfectly located just outside the hustle of the city with a short walk to travel links and the trendy streets of Jordaan district.  Key collection was easy from just outside the station and Lisane's communication prior to arrival was great so we knew just what to do.  Apartment was a great space and the roof terrace was ideal for the sunny weather we had.  All in all it was ideal for our needs it would have been nice to stay longer.
384909,104855813,2016-09-28,5222408,Michael,"Lisanne is a generous and gracious AirBnB host - truly among the best that I've encountered.  I felt very much at home in her flat in large part to Lisanne's hospitality, and then because as the other reviews indicate, it is perfectly situated, well appointed, and warmly decorated.  I most appreciated the extremely comfortable bed because I woke up refreshed and ready to explore Amsterdam each day and Netflix on the TV because, well, I'm a TV junkie.  

Many frequent AirBnB'ers have likely become used to sterile flats that are investment properties for hosts.  Lisanne lives in her flat at times and you will find traces of her throughout the apartment like clothes in the wardrobe, food in the fridge, a hairband on the nightstand.  In general there's more stuff than in the photos.  Your experience will be more like staying at a cool, Bohemian friend's place while she's out of town than staying in a corporate apartment.  This is your home away from home in Amsterdam! "

It was easy to find from the address even though it was dark when we arrived. The key was left for us and they were expecting us so ther was no problem getting the key and the instructions to get access to the loft were accurate. The description and pictures are accurate, the roof terrace was lovely. 
The steps to get up to the loft are quite steep so people with poor mobility will struggle. "

384909,139956314,2017-03-27,21073386,Rachel,"A nice top floor apartment with roof terrace.  It's a great eclectic mix of art and furniture with beautiful elm floors, rugs and large windows which allow light to flood in.  The bed was very comfortable, lovely organic hand wash and the location is in a quiet street with excellent cafes just a few minutes walk.  It is a 20 minute walk from the central station. "
384909,142860669,2017-04-09,84632732,Andrea,"Very good location, super cool apartment, Lisanne is very nice host, even though we were late, she found the way, how to give us the keys. Staying at her place, you feel like you are a part of her family, her home feels very cosy."
384909,145600548,2017-04-19,82887812,Mark,"Awesome stay! Very cozy and felt right at home. Great vibe and loved the rooftop terrace.

384909,179414567,2017-08-07,60492382,Sophie,"Lisanne's apartment was great: stylish decoration, cozy, and very well situated in the Jordaan area. We absolutely loved the rooftop terrace! The neighborhood is lovely and quiet at night, and you can easily reach the  lively centre of Amsterdam in a few minutes walk. We found this apartment to be the perfect place from which to explore Amsterdam!"
384909,194625240,2017-09-17,5226347,Alexander,"Lisanne's home is a charming, character-filled space in the heart of the trendy Jordaan neighbourhood.  It's incredibly convenient for zipping in and out of the pleasant pockets of Amsterdam that make the city so lovely."
384909,199096594,2017-10-01,72166947,Sébastien,Lovely place in a quiet yet lively area. Great stay !
384909,213265099,2017-11-20,31514264,Alex,"Lisannes apartment was a perfect base from which to explore the city, set in a cool part of the city with a lot of local bars and restaurants. She provided a handy booklet with tips and recommendations for places to eat and drink and local conveniences.

The apartment was very cool, I stayed with 2 friends, there was more than enough space. Check in was flexible, Lisanne accommodated a later check out as we had a late flight back. 

In all it was a great apartment to stay in while in Amsterdam, I couldn't recommend highly enough."
384909,235962384,2018-02-18,63345201,Tom,A great space in a brilliant location. Would thoroughly recommend.
384909,238648566,2018-02-26,4596544,Alex,"Lisanne, was extremely hospitable and accommodated my arrival with ease.  The home was gorgeous with a lovely vibe of spirituality, and the rooftop deck was great for an early morning meditation session.  The stay was comfortable, and the place made me feel at home."
384909,242006243,2018-03-11,176926642,Steven,"Très bon emplacement, Lisanne est très cool. l’appartement est très sympa on se sent comme à la maison..."
384909,249912014,2018-04-03,10607889,Caroline,"Great location and lots of space. Unfortunately it was too cold for us to use the rooftop - perhaps next time! There were some concerning cleanliness issues, but hopefully this could be rectified for future guests."
384909,254282474,2018-04-16,5312766,Guilhem,"Emplacement parfait, Lisanne est très réactive et à l'écoute. Appartement très bien équipé et confortable, mais un peu juste au niveau de la literie pour 3. Hautement recommandé pour un couple!"
384909,256922156,2018-04-24,12484319,Sonali,"Lisanne's apartment is lovely, and perfectly located for a visit to Amsterdam. The neighbourhood is safe and charming, and close to everything! The apartment is as pictured, but definitely is a bit of a climb to get to. When we were staying there, there was construction happening above and around us, but there is also a roofdeck for visitors. Lisanne has a lot of resources for new visitors, and a comfortable home. Our only issue is that we found a mouse in the apartment during our stay, near where one of us was sleeping. Lisanne said this was normal for older houses in Amsterdam. Other than that, we had a good trip, and I would recommend this apartment, especially for the location."
384909,258357814,2018-04-29,139267374,Sarah,"The appartement is very stylish, close to the city center and has an amazing view from the terrace! Lisanne is a very helpful host, she gave us many tips for enjoying Amsterdam and King’s day."
384909,261835009,2018-05-07,90030770,Mélanie,"L'appartement est très beau, très bien équipé, Avec un toit terrasse parfait sous le soleil. Le quartier est super, la rue est calme, et tout est à proximité. J'y retournerais sans hésiter."
384909,266571005,2018-05-20,182125362,Carmela,"L' appartamento è  molto luminoso, con una terrazza magnifica, in una posizione centrale ma non si è rivelato all'altezza delle aspettative:
Il Frigorifero era sporco e maleodorante, colmo di cose già utilizzate e cibi scaduti e con la muffa : insalata , cavolo, etc. . 
La lavastoviglie era colma di cose sporche già al nostro arrivo . I cassetti con le posate era poco pulito e con briciole 
Non c'era un armadio libero o un solo cassetto dove si potesse riporre i nostri vestiti - L'unico armadio presente era già colmo di indumenti
 il terzo letto che doveva essere  -secondo le informazioni dell' annuncio - un divano letto in soggiorno, in realtà era un semplice materasso posizionato per terra in sala, dove non c'erano tende o persiane, pertanto la luce entrava già alle prime ore dell'alba
Nella camera con il letto matrimoniale non c'era luce elettrica con cui si potesse vedere o leggere ma solo due abatjour rosse con una luminosità fioca che non permetteva di vedere durante le ore serali/notturne.

384909,284081306,2018-07-01,25111079,Soumik,Lisanne's place was great! Very cool place (roof and interior are 100)  located centrally in the Jordaan neighborhood. She was accommodating and we had a great stay. Would definitely stay here if I'm visiting the city again. Would recommend!

Really nice terrasse view, comfy bed
Good tips from Lisanne for Groceries, restaurants etc 
Everything was good expected that it wasn’t as clean as I expected"

384909,423410379,2019-03-14,229918101,Ray,"GPS when you reach the general area of the Colosseum goes crazy. I was a little late. Dolores was was pleasant, easy to get a long with. The yoga is taught in a beautiful room. Nice easy flow, with some longer held asana. Nice stretch, and chance to recharge after walking the streets of Rome."
384909,490771829,2019-07-19,6986855,Danja,"I have spent six years using airbnb and this is my first review of this nature. The house manual is lengthy, with some good information however not helpful for some things we were looking for. For instance, Bedroom has a fan, remote wasnt in sight, nor found where the manual states. Our host was quick to respond to any issue we had, thankful for that. She instructed me to look in a couple of top drawers that contained personal belongings, was nowhere to be found. Not typical for Amsterdam to have A/C (which we knew), but that fan would have helped as sleeping with the natural air caused congestion after the first night. Hammock and cushioned chairs are listed in photo on rooftop but not there upon arrival. Comfortable rooftop is key in this listing and it wasnt communicated to us prior to arrival to expect anything different, we could have had time (and half our refund) to search elsewhere if we had known. Little things were a struggle that arent in the manual. Like that top drawer under the oven for the silverware, or if the hot water goes out which switch to flip. The outside building door made me nervous that i was going to get locked out if i went out alone because you have to maneuver it open. One time the neighbor helped us inside after hearing us struggle to open the door. Towels not in the bathroom as well as not a lot of space to unpack anywhere as shelves and drawers are taken up with decorations and/or personal items. We used the laundry and there were things out on the line. We truly felt we were in someone else's space and they were just out of the home for a couple days. It was uncomfortable. Its not easy dragging clothes up and down the steep and narrow steps up to the roof. Neighbors are easily heard, i understand its not the hosts fault however the yelling was hard to ignore from inside and outside. As was the clocktower at night ringing. For the first time in my airbnb experience, I asked for a refund before the night was over on our first night as we had not used any of the amenities and already uncomfortable. The living room light hangs very low so its hard not to hit your head each time you get off the couch. The host said she felt rushed in meeting us which didnt allow her to properly explain things and that she is not a hotel. I made her aware of our long travel day before meeting. Its not my experience to meet the host, especially with such a detailed house manual and self check in. We were thankful for the help up the stairs with our luggage and the apartment is cute, walkable to anne frank house and some nice spots to eat and enjoy.  Our expectation is not that of a hotel, but to be comfortable and have a local home to ourselves without feeling like we are intruding in someones space. We were able to stay elsewhere for our second night as the host allowed a refund when I asked again. Host communicated well and was friendly throughout, this apartment is cute however this listing is priced way too much for the quality received. Overall, I would not recommend this listing."
384909,501157574,2019-08-03,106520751,Siddharth,"Had a great stay with Lisanne. She was a great host who responded quickly and was very accommodating. The apartment was clean, comfortable and in a location that lets you be close to everything while having your own quiet space in a residential area. Having a   private terrace made the stay extra special. Overall had a wonderful time and would definitely stay there again, highly recommend."
384909,550711916,2019-10-19,32586089,Audrey,The location of the apartment is perfect for exploring Amsterdam.  Lisanne was available during our trip to answer any questions and make suggestions.  The rooftop is a great feature to have to relax after a day of exploring.  There are some really great local restaurants close by.
384909,561847383,2019-11-10,30764136,Christian,"Great apartment in a wonderful location on the edge of the Jordaan. Short walk to all sorts of cafes, bars and restaurants, plus all of the delights of the Jordaan and the Prinsengracht. Recommended."

There is a supermarket only a couple of minutes walk away and the canal is just at the end of the road, really really beautiful surroundings. The walk to the main shopping and best bar area is also only about a 20minute walk away (straight along the canal) and Vondelpark only another 5 minutes from there. so it is in a perfect location. I absolutely loved staying in this apartment, it's as great as the pictures show! x  p.s i recommend renting the pedal boats!"
387644,2807952,2012-11-05,3542857,Vera,"Cute, clean apartment with great style! Location is perfect: near restaurants, bars, boutiques and grocery stores in a central spot.

I did not meet Melih at check-in but he arranged to have someone meet me and check-in went very smoothly. The flat is very close to the tram and bars and restaurants are walk-able as well.  The flat is very nice, stylish, and comfortable with lots of light from large windows.  I was able to make good use of the office space for work and it has a lovely balcony.  I highly recommend this flat."
387644,3382848,2013-01-21,1775344,Tuija,I really enjoyed staying at Melih´s apartment which is decorated with such a great style and is a perfect place to stay for an individual or a couple. It is located in a quiet but well connected street. It was easy to communicate with Melih prior to my visit to arrange delivery of the keys etc. A red wine bottle awaited me on the table which was lovely. I would love to stay again at his flat.    
387644,3411344,2013-01-25,13700,Petra,"We had a fantastic stay at this clean, quiet and charming place. The location is perfect and the flat has all one can whish for.

387644,3455351,2013-02-01,4788078,Suzanne,"This was my first visit to Amsterdam and i loved every minute of it. The apartment just made the whole stay even better! Clear and easy instructions and communication with Melih. The apartment was clean, stylish and had everything we needed for our stay. Close to all the major attractions, i purchased a three day tram ticket but walked everywhere! Will be back for sure!! Thank you Melih xxx ( oh and thanks for the wine and chocolates)"
387644,3497052,2013-02-08,4252792,Nina,"The apartment is great! We loved to stay there! We felt at home at the very first moment.
